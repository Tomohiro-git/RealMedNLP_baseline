<article id="JP0217-100" title="非小細胞肺癌に対する放射線化学療法施行後の抗PD-Ll抗体投与が影響したと思われる壊死性多発肝腫瘤の1例">
This case report is for a <timex3 type="age">70-year-old</timex3> male.
The patient was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of <d certainty="positive">hemoptysis</d>, and was diagnosed with <d certainty="positive">non-small cell lung cancer</d> based on the findings of the <t-test state="executed">CT scan and bronchoscopy</t-test>.
<timex3 type="date">Then</timex3>, while <r state="executed">durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody)</r> was dosed as <r state="executed">maintenance therapy</r> for <timex3 type="med">two courses</timex3> of <r state="executed">radiochemotherapy (S-1 + CDDP)</r>, we observed <d certainty="positive">fever and increased inflammatory response</d>.
Thus, <m-key state="executed">LVFX</m-key> was started <timex3 type="med">5 days after</timex3> <m-key state="executed">anti-PD-L1 antibody</m-key> therapy was started.
After the <timex3 type="med">third dose</timex3> of <m-key state="executed">LVFX</m-key>, the <t-test state="executed">blood work</t-test> showed a <c>further increase</c> in the level of <d certainty="positive">hepatic dysfunction</d> coupled with an <d certainty="positive">inflammatory response</d>.
It was decided to order a <t-test state="executed">contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT)</t-test>.
It revealed <f>multiple</f> <d certainty="positive">small, poorly contrast enhanced masses</d> in the <a>hepatic region inside the radiated area</a> by the <r state="executed">radiotherapy</r> that had been given for the treatment of the <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d>.
We suspected <d certainty="suspicious">multiple liver abscesses or multiple liver metastases of the lung cancer</d>, and performed a <t-test state="executed">liver tumor biopsy</t-test>.
Histopathological findings showed <f>scattered</f> <d certainty="positive">hepatocellular necrosis, which was thought to be coagulation necrosis</d>, but there was no <f>obvious</f> sign of <d certainty="negative">invasion of the lung cancer into the liver</d>.
A <t-test state="executed">blood culture</t-test> was also taken, but no <d certainty="negative">bacteria</d> were found.
Based on the results, we concluded that the patient had <d certainty="positive">multiple hepatic masses due to inflammation</d>, and the original course of <m-key state="executed">antibiotics</m-key> was continued; the patient's <d certainty="positive">inflammatory response</d> <c>improved</c> <timex3 type="med">one week after starting dosage</timex3> of the <m-key state="executed">antibiotics</m-key>.
However, an <t-test state="executed">EOB-MRI</t-test> performed at the <timex3 type="date">same time</timex3> showed that the <d certainty="positive">multiple liver masses</d> still <c>presented</c>.
The <t-test state="executed">CT scan</t-test> performed <timex3 type="date">2 months later</timex3> showed a <c>decrease</c> in the <d certainty="positive">hepatic mass</d>, and the <t-test state="executed">CT scan</t-test> performed <timex3 type="date">3 months later</timex3> showed that the <d certainty="negative">hepatic mass</d> had <f>almost completely</f> <c>disappeared</c>.
Discussion: We managed a case involving <d certainty="positive">necrotizing multiple hepatic masses</d> probably caused by the administration of the <m-key state="executed">anti-PD-L1 antibody</m-key> <timex3 type="med">following</timex3> the course of <cc state="executed">radiochemotherapy</cc> given to treat <d certainty="positive">non-small cell lung cancer</d>.
<timex3 type="date">In recent years</timex3>, <m-key state="other">immune checkpoint inhibitors</m-key>, including <m-key state="other">anti-PD-L1 antibodies</m-key>, have been used for the treatment of <d certainty="general">various types of cancer</d>, but current experience remains limited and the <d certainty="general">side effects</d> are not fully understood.
The histopathological findings in this case supported a <d certainty="suspicious">suspicion of hepatotoxicity</d> caused by the <r state="executed">radiochemotherapy</r> rather than an <d certainty="negative">autoimmune</d> mechanism caused by <m-key state="executed">immune checkpoint inhibitors</m-key>, but nonetheless the <c>emergence</c> of <f>necrotic</f> <d certainty="positive">multiple hepatic masses</d> in <a>the irradiated liver</a> due to <r state="executed">radiochemotherapy</r> acting alone is extremely rare.
Therefore, it is most reasonable to assume that the administration of the <m-key state="executed">anti-PD-L1 antibody</m-key>, in conjunction with the <r state="executed">radiochemotherapy</r>, effected the <c>development</c> of the <d certainty="positive">necrotic multiple hepatic masses</d> for this case.
Conclusion: We managed a case involving <d certainty="positive">necrotizing multiple hepatic masses</d> that was probably impacted by the administration of the <m-key state="executed">anti-PD-LI antibody</m-key> <timex3 type="med">following</timex3> <r state="executed">radiochemotherapy</r> had been given for the treatment of <d certainty="positive">non-small cell lung cancer</d>.
We decided to report this case, which we believe will be of considerable interest, because as far as we know, to date no similar case has been reported.

Background: <m-key state="other">Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)</m-key> are now available for use in treatment of a variety of diseases, and reports of <d certainty="general">immune-related adverse events (irAEs)</d> specific to <d certainty="general">side effects</d>, have been on the increase.
Although <d certainty="general">autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) like pathological findings</d> have been reported in <a>liver</a> related <d certainty="general">irAE</d>, <timex3 type="date">in recent years</timex3> <d certainty="general">cholangitis</d> has also been reported.
In <timex3 type="date">this study</timex3> we report our experience with a case of <d certainty="positive">cholangitis involving nivolumab</d> which had a <f>variety</f> of <d certainty="positive">histopathological findings</d>.
Case Report: <timex3 type="age">64-year-old</timex3> male, who <timex3 type="date">1 year ago</timex3>, underwent a <r state="executed">pylorus-preserving gastrectomy</r> for the treatment of <d certainty="positive">gastric cancer</d>.
The patient received <m-key state="executed">nivolumab</m-key> as <r state="executed">3rd line chemotherapy</r> for prevention of <timex3 type="med">postoperative</timex3> complications of <d certainty="positive">peritoneal and left supraclavicular lymph node recurrence</d>.
<timex3 type="med">After 3 courses</timex3> of <m-key state="executed">nivolumab</m-key>, the patient <c>presented</c> a <d certainty="positive">psoriasis type drug eruption</d>.
<timex3 type="time">Concomitantly</timex3>, the <t-key>hepatobiliary enzymes</t-key> <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>93 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>94 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>1341 U/L</t-val> and <t-key>γGTP</t-key> <t-val>149 U/L</t-val> were <c>found to be elevated</c>.
The <d certainty="negative">hepatitis virus marker</d> was negative, <t-key>anti-nuclear antibody</t-key> <t-val>80X</t-val>, <d certainty="negative">anti-mitochondrial antibody</d> negative, <t-key>IgG</t-key> <t-val>1645.6 mg/dL</t-val>, <t-key>IgG4</t-key> <t-val>20.5 mg/dL</t-val> and <t-key>IgM</t-key> <t-val>45.1 mg/dL</t-val>.
<t-test state="executed">CT and MRCP</t-test> gave no evidence of <d certainty="negative">dilatation</d> of the <a>common bile duct or intrahepatic bile duct</a>.
Since <d certainty="suspicious">irAE</d> was suspected, a <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> was ordered.
Histopathological findings showed <f>moderate</f> <d certainty="positive">inflammatory cell infiltration and endotheliitis</d> in the <a>portal region</a>, with <d certainty="positive">damage to the bile duct epithelium, along with lymphocytic infiltration</d> of the <a>bile duct</a>.
In <a>the lobules</a>, there were <d certainty="positive">noncaseating epithelial cell granulomas containing Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells</d>.
The <d certainty="positive">lymphocytes</d> in the <a>portal vein area</a> were <d certainty="positive">CD8-positive and CD4-positive</d>, and <d certainty="positive">cholangitis involving nivolumab</d> was the diagnosis.
<timex3 type="date">After 3 weeks</timex3> of treatment with <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> <m-val>0.5 mg/kg</m-val>, <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>11 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>26 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>566 U/L</t-val>, and <t-key>γGTP</t-key> <t-val>73 U/L</t-val> values improved.
However, the patient suffered a <d certainty="positive">relapse</d> <timex3 type="med">2 weeks after reducing</timex3> the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> dosage to <m-val>0.4 mg/kg</m-val>.
<timex3 type="date">4 weeks later</timex3>, <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>100 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>104 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>1215 U/L</t-val> and <t-key>γGTP</t-key> <t-val>328 U/L</t-val> values had <c>worsened</c>.
A second <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> was ordered.
Histopathological findings of the <timex3 type="date">second</timex3> <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> showed <f>moderate</f> <d certainty="positive">inflammatory cell infiltration</d> <a>in the portal region</a> and a <f>small number</f> of <d certainty="positive">plasma cells</d>.
<d certainty="positive">Inter-face hepatitis</d>, <d certainty="positive">lymphoid infiltration</d> of the <a>bile duct epithelium</a>, and <a>lobular</a> <d certainty="positive">lymphocyte aggregation</d> were also observed.
The <d certainty="positive">infiltrating lymphocytes</d> were <d certainty="positive">CD8-positive and CD4-positive</d>, <c>identical</c> to the <timex3 type="date">first</timex3> biopsy.
<timex3 type="med">After increasing</timex3> the dosage of <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> to <m-val>1 mg/kg</m-val>, <t-key>hepatobiliary enzyme</t-key> levels <c>decreased</c>, and even after <c>reducing</c> the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> dosage to <m-val>0.2 mg/kg</m-val>, no <d certainty="negative">relapse</d> occurred.
Discussion: <m-key state="other">ICI</m-key> related <d certainty="general">hepatotoxicity</d> presented with a <f>variety</f> of <d certainty="general">histological features</d>.
In this case, the <timex3 type="date">first</timex3> <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> revealed <d certainty="positive">granuloma formation</d> and the <d certainty="general">visual was similar to that associated with primary bilious cholangitis</d>.
The <timex3 type="date">second</timex3> <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> revealed <f>AIH like</f> findings, i.e.
<d certainty="positive">plasma cell infiltration and interface hepatitis</d>, suggesting that there are <f>various</f> pathogenesis mechanisms for <m-key state="other">ICI</m-key> related <d certainty="general">liver disorders</d>.

Case Report: A male <timex3 type="age">in his 60s</timex3>, was receiving <m-key state="executed">nivolumab</m-key> <m-val>150 mg</m-val> <timex3 type="duration">every 2 weeks</timex3> as <r state="executed">second-line</r> treatment for his <d certainty="positive">laryngeal cancer</d> at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology in our hospital.
<timex3 type="med">Four months after starting treatment</timex3>, <t-test state="executed">blood work</t-test> results at: <t-key>T-bil</t-key> <t-val>0.81 mg/dl</t-val>, <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>91 U/l</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>144 U/l</t-val>, <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>1478 U/l</t-val> and <t-key>γGT</t-key> <t-val>426 U/l</t-val>.
Since <d certainty="positive">liver damage</d> with the <f>dominance</f> of <t-key>biliary enzymes</t-key> was also observed, the patient was referred to the Department of Gastroenterology.
The patient had no <d certainty="negative">subjective symptoms</d> and other than a <d certainty="positive">fever</d> of <f>37.6°C</f> there were no special <d certainty="negative">findings upon abdominal examination</d>.
<t-test state="executed">Blood biochemical tests</t-test> showed that <d certainty="negative">various viral markers, i.e. ANA and AMA2,</d> were negative, and <t-key>IgG and IgG4</t-key> were within <f>normal limits</f>.
The <t-test state="executed">CT scan</t-test> showed <d certainty="positive">enlarged gallbladder and thickened gallbladder wall</d> along with <d certainty="positive">diffuse dilatation and wall thickening</d> of the <a>common bile duct, and right and left hepatic ducts</a>, but <t-test state="executed">MRCP and ERC</t-test> did not show any <d certainty="negative">stenosis or neoplastic lesions</d> in the <a>bile ducts</a>.
<a>Hepatic tissue</a> was <f>free</f> of <d certainty="negative">inflammatory changes or necrosis of the hepatocytes</d>, but there were <f>various</f> <d certainty="positive">inflammatory cell infiltrates</d> in the <a>portal region</a> and <f>some</f> <d certainty="positive">chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis</d>.
We suspected <m-key state="executed">immune checkpoint inhibitor</m-key> related <d certainty="suspicious">cholangitis</d> and so <c>discontinued</c> the <m-key state="negated">nivolumab</m-key>, but the biochemical and imaging findings <c>showed no improvement</c>, so a course of <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> <m-val>30 mg</m-val> was started.
<t-key>Hepatobiliary enzymes</t-key> levels <f>slowly</f> <c>improved</c>, but when the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> dose was <c>reduced</c> to <m-val>15 mg</m-val>, there was <d certainty="positive">further exacerbation of the cholangitis</d> and so <m-key state="executed">UDCA</m-key> <m-val>600 mg</m-val> was started.
<timex3 type="date">Thereafter,</timex3> the <d certainty="positive">cholangitis</d> <c>improved</c>, and <m-key state="negated">PSL</m-key> was terminated and only <m-key state="executed">UDCA</m-key> was administered.
<m-key state="executed">Nivolumab</m-key> had not failed the patient, but <timex3 type="med">after the medication was stopped</timex3> the <d certainty="positive">tumor</d> <c>progressed</c>.
<r state="executed">Systematic chemotherapy</r> using <m-key state="executed">cytotoxic anticancer drug</m-key> proved ineffective, however <timex3 type="duration">while undergoing the cancer therapy</timex3> the patient's <d certainty="negative">cholangitis</d> was not exacerbated.
Therefore, in support of the patient's strong request, it was agreed to restart the <m-key state="executed">Nivolumab</m-key>.
<timex3 type="duration">More than 8 months later</timex3>, there were no signs that the <t-key>liver function</t-key> was <c>further compromised</c>, and furthermore, the <d certainty="positive">tumor</d> had started to <c>shrink</c> again.
Reports of <d certainty="general">cholangitis</d> being a <d certainty="general">side effect (irAE)</d> associated with <m-key state="other">immune checkpoint inhibitors</m-key> are rare.
<timex3 type="time">As of this writing</timex3>, there is no consensus on how to treat.

Opening Remarks: <m-key state="other">Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)</m-key> are immunotherapy drugs that are able to suppress a tumor by inhibiting the immunosuppressive response and allow the immune system to attack the tumor.
After ICIs were approved for use in the treatment of <d certainty="general">malignant melanoma</d> in <timex3 type="date">2014</timex3>, their use has expanded to include the treatment of <d certainty="general">gastric cancer</d>, and others.
However the frequency of <d certainty="general">immune-related adverse events (irAEs)</d> has also been on the rise.
<d certainty="general">Hepatotoxicity irAEs</d> have a <f>variety</f> of clinical manifestations with much still remaining unclear.
<timex3 type="date">Here</timex3> we report a case of <d certainty="suspicious">hepatic impairment</d> we suspect was caused by an <t-test state="executed">immune checkpoint inhibitor</t-test>.
Case Report: Female <timex3 type="age">in her 70s</timex3>.
Past Medical History: <d certainty="positive">Hypertension, hyperlipidemia</d>.
History of alcohol consumption: None.
Current Medical History: <m-key state="executed">Nivolumab</m-key>, an <m-key state="executed">anti-PD1 antibody</m-key>, was prescribed by the Department of Dermatology at our hospital to treat <d certainty="positive">vulvar malignant melanoma and lung metastasis</d> in <timex3 type="date">June, 1 year before 20XX</timex3>.
<timex3 type="date">Subsequently,</timex3> the <d certainty="positive">lung metastases</d> <c>tended to shrink</c>, and the <d certainty="negative">primary vulvar tumor</d> was <r state="executed">resected</r> in <timex3 type="date">November, 1 year before 20XX</timex3>.
<m-key state="executed">Nivolumab</m-key> was administered for <r state="executed">up to 15 courses</r>, but in <timex3 type="date">January 20XX</timex3>, <d certainty="positive">metastatic lesions</d> <c>presented</c> in the <a>vulva</a>, and the <d certainty="positive">lung metastatic lesions</d> <c>tended to increase</c>.
<m-key state="executed">Ipilimumab</m-key>, an <m-key state="executed">anti-CTLA-4 antibody</m-key>, was started in <timex3 type="date">late February 20XX,</timex3> and a <r state="executed">second course was administered</r> up until <timex3 type="date">mid-March</timex3>.
<timex3 type="date">In early April 20XX</timex3>, <timex3 type="med">when the patient was admitted to the hospital's dermatology department</timex3>, there were no subjective symptoms.
However the <t-test state="executed">blood test</t-test> results were: <t-key>T-Bil</t-key> <t-val>0.7 mg/dL</t-val>, <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>6781 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>5381 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>211 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>γ-GTP</t-key> <t-val>481 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>PT</t-key> <t-val>87.2%</t-val>, <t-key>white blood cell count</t-key> <t-val>7,950/μL</t-val> and <t-key>CRP</t-key> <t-val>3.97 mg/dL</t-val>, <c>indicating</c> <f>mild</f> <d certainty="positive">liver dysfunction with an inflammatory reaction</d>, and the patient was referred to our department for a <cc state="executed">consult</cc>.
Both the <t-test state="executed">hepatitis virus and autoantibody tests</t-test> were <t-val>negative</t-val>.
<t-test state="executed">Abdominal echography</t-test> revealed <c>no morphological changes</c> in the <a>liver</a> and no significant findings for the <a>bile ducts</a>.
<t-test state="executed">Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen</t-test> revealed no <d certainty="negative">malignant hepatic lesions, hepatic infarction, portal vein thrombus or bile duct malignancy</d>.
A <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> was performed <timex3 type="date">3 days later</timex3> and revealed <d certainty="positive">increased collagen fibers and inflammatory cell infiltration, mainly lymphocytes</d>, in the <a>portal and central venous regions</a>, but only <f>minimal</f> <d certainty="positive">inflammatory cell infiltration</d> in the <a>bile duct epithelium</a> and no <d certainty="negative">fibrous thickening</d> of the <a>bile ducts</a>.
<p>The score, in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for drug-induced liver injury revised by the DDW-J 2004 Workshop, for</p><m-key state="executed">nivolumab</m-key> was <p>8 points</p> and for <m-key state="executed">ipilimumab</m-key> <p>9 points</p>.
Therefore, it was considered as a possible suspect for this apparent <d certainty="positive">drug-induced hepatic impairment</d>.
<m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> <m-val>45 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day)</m-val> was administered <timex3 type="date">from the 4th day</timex3>.
The level of <d certainty="positive">hepatic dysfunction</d> <c>decreased</c>, and the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> was <c>gradually tapered off</c>.
The patient was <cc state="executed">discharged</cc> <timex3 type="date">49 days after her illness commenced</timex3>.
Discussion: <d certainty="general">IrAEs</d> as a proximate cause of <d certainty="general">liver damage, hepatitis with elevated hepatobiliary enzymes, hepatitis and sclerosing cholangitis</d> have been reported.
It should be noted that the mechanism of <m-key state="other">ICIs</m-key> induced hepatotoxicity is different from that of conventional <f>allergic or metabolic</f> <d certainty="general">drug induced hepatotoxicity</d> inasmuch as the former may <c>appear</c> as an <d certainty="general">autoimmune response</d>, in addition to <d certainty="general">cross-reactivity between neoantigen and autoantigen</d> in <a>cancer cells</a>.
From the progression of the illness it was suspected that <d certainty="suspicious">ICIs might be the cause of the liver damage</d> and the findings of the <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> formed the basis of our evaluation.

<article id="JP0217-107" title="高度胆汁うっ滞性肝不全を呈した肝関連irAEの一例">
Opening Remarks: <timex3 type="date">In recent years</timex3>, for the treatment of several different types of <d certainty="general">malignant cancer</d>, <m-key state="other">immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)</m-key> have proven promising, with their efficacy duly recognized.
Although ICIs can be effective in attacking a tumor by the inhibition of immunosuppressive signals, there have also been reports of <d certainty="general">immune-related adverse events (irAEs)</d> affecting <a>various organs</a>.
In <timex3 type="date">this</timex3> report we describe a <f>remarkable</f> case of <d certainty="positive">bile stasis liver failure</d> that occurred <timex3 type="med">after the use</timex3> of an <m-key state="executed">ICI</m-key>.
Case Report: <timex3 type="age">83-year-old</timex3> male being dosed with <m-key state="negated">ICI (nivolumab and ipilimumab)</m-key> for <d certainty="positive">recurrent pleural metastasis</d> of <d certainty="positive">renal cell carcinoma</d>.
The drugs had been administered <timex3 type="set">4 times</timex3>, but the medication was halted due to the <c>worsened condition</c>.
<timex3 type="date">Later</timex3>, <m-key state="executed">pazopanib</m-key> was administered, but it was observed that <d certainty="positive">jaundice and liver failure</d> <c>had set in</c>.
Since the condition continued to <c>worsen</c>, <m-key state="negated">pazopanib</m-key> was halted and the patient was started on <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> <m-val>60 mg</m-val>, but due to <c>worsening</c> <d certainty="positive">jaundice</d>, the patient was <cc state="executed">transferred to our department</cc>.
Although the patient was <timex3 type="med">transferred to our department</timex3> and treated with <r state="executed">steroid pulse therapy</r>, the <d certainty="positive">jaundice</d> <c>did not improve</c>.
The <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> showed <d certainty="positive">chronic non-pyogenic destructive cholangitis, marked bile stasis</d>, and <f>PBC-like</f> findings.
The <d certainty="positive">infiltrating lymphocytes</d> were <f>CD8 positive</f> and thought to be due to an <d certainty="positive">irAE</d>.
<m-key state="executed">Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)</m-key> was administered, but the patient's <d certainty="positive">general condition deteriorated</d> <timex3 type="med">after several days of being on the medication</timex3>, and he died.
Discussion: Although <m-key state="other">steroids</m-key> are recommended for the treatment of <d certainty="general">irAE induced liver disease</d>, in this case the condition proved <f>refractory</f> for both <r state="executed">pulse therapy and steroids</r>.
<timex3 type="time">In recent years</timex3> various levels of <d certainty="general">bile duct injury</d> have been reported in connection with <d certainty="general">liver related irAEs</d>.
<f>Steroid resistance</f> for cases involving <d certainty="general">liver damage, including bile duct injury, which are irAEs related</d> have also been reported.
The use of <m-key state="other">MMF</m-key> has been reported to be effective in <f>steroid resistant</f> patients, and was introduced in this case, but it was not possible to evaluate its efficacy.
Although the number of cases of <d certainty="general">liver damage due to irAEs</d> is expected to increase in the <timex3 type="date">future</timex3>, it is necessary to build up a number of cases and to also consider early <r state="other">immunosuppressive therapy</r> as part of the treatment strategy.

Case Report: A <timex3 type="age">74-year-old</timex3> female.
The patient was <timex3 type="med">receiving outpatient treatment</timex3> at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in our hospital for <d certainty="positive">pulmonary and splenic metastasis of uterine leiomyosarcoma</d>.
<timex3 type="date">On December 19, 201X</timex3> the patient was started on <m-val>800 mg</m-val> of <m-key state="executed">oral pazopanib</m-key>.
For the <t-test state="executed">blood sample taken</t-test> <timex3 type="date">on January 22, one year after 201X</timex3> the results were: <t-key>T-Bil </t-key> <t-val>7.85 mg/dl</t-val>, <t-key>D-Bil</t-key> <t-val>5.07 mg/dl</t-val>, <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>559 IU/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>515 IU/L</t-val>, <t-key>LDH</t-key> <t-val>747 IU/L</t-val> and <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>1490 IU/L</t-val>, indicating a <f>mixed type</f> of <f>markedly</f> <d certainty="positive">elevated liver enzymes</d>, which resulted in our department being called in for a <cc state="executed">consult</cc>.
<t-key>Autoantibodies</t-key> and <t-key>viral markers</t-key> were <t-val>negative</t-val>.
<t-key>DLST</t-key> for <m-key state="executed">pazopanib</m-key> was <t-val>negative</t-val>.
As per the DDW-J 2004 Drug-Induced Liver Injury Workshop scoring, the <t-key>total score</t-key>: <t-val>5 points</t-val>, <t-key>days since onset</t-key>: <t-val>2 points</t-val>, <t-key>existence of non-drug related causes (Y/N)</t-key>: <t-val>2 points</t-val> and <t-key>previous liver disorder reported</t-key>: <t-val>1 point</t-val>.
We suspected <d certainty="suspicious">drug-induced hepatotoxicity</d> due to <m-key state="negated">pazopanib</m-key> and decided to discontinue the medication and <cc state="executed">follow-up</cc> with the patient.
However, for the <t-test state="executed">blood sample taken</t-test> <timex3 type="date">one week later</timex3> the results were: <t-key>T-Bil</t-key> <t-val>22.37 mg/dl</t-val>, <t-key>D-Bil</t-key> <t-val>15.02 mg/dl</t-val>, <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>447 IU/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>348 IU/L</t-val> <t-key>LDH</t-key> <t-val>499 IU/L</t-val> and <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>2360 IU/L</t-val>, indicating that the patient's <d certainty="positive">liver function had tended to worsen</d> due to <f>cholestasis</f>.
A <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> was performed on the <timex3 type="date">same day</timex3> in order to investigate the cause.
The <a>liver histology</a> showed <d certainty="positive">cholestasis</d> in the <a>hepatocytes around the central vein</a>, <d certainty="positive">inflammatory cell infiltration</d> with <f>small lymphocytes</f> in <a>Glisson's sheath</a> and <f>focal</f> <d certainty="positive">hepatocellular necrosis</d> <a>in the lobules</a>, indicating <d certainty="positive">drug-induced hepatic impairment with impaired bile transport and hepatitis</d>.
The possibility of <d certainty="suspicious">tumor</d> <c>exacerbation</c> was considered, but <d certainty="positive">liver function abnormalities</d> were the <f>main findings</f>, and so <r state="executed">steroid pulse therapy (500 mg/day)</r> was started the <timex3 type="date">same day</timex3>.
<timex3 type="date">After 1 week</timex3>, the <t-key>hepatobiliary enzymes</t-key> showed <c>signs of improving</c>, and the <m-key state="executed">steroid dose</m-key> was <c>gradually tapered off</c>.
<timex3 type="med">2 months later</timex3> the <t-key>hepatobiliary enzymes</t-key> had <c>normalized</c>.
Although there have been many reports in Japan of <d certainty="general">drug-induced hepatic impairment</d> caused by <m-key state="other">pazopanib</m-key>, there are few reports of a <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> performed at <f>Grade 4</f>, as in this case, resulting in a definitive diagnosis.
<timex3 type="date">Here</timex3> we report a case of <d certainty="positive">drug-induced hepatotoxicity</d> due to the taking of <m-key state="executed">pazopanib</m-key> for a patient who responded to <r state="executed">pulsed steroid therapy</r>, and include our experience as drawn from other cases we have handled.

Objective: <m-key state="other">immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)</m-key> have demonstrated an ability to fight tumors by suppressing the immune system.
On the other hand, ICIs are known to cause <d certainty="general">immune-related Adverse Effects (irAEs)</d> in various organs, and some cases, deaths have been reported.
<d certainty="general">Hepatotoxicity</d> is a <f>frequent</f> <d certainty="general">immune-related adverse effect</d>.
According to the package insert, <d certainty="general">hepatotoxicity and hepatitis</d> are observed in <f>approximately 10%</f> of all patients.
A <t-test state="other">liver biopsy</t-test> can show an <d certainty="general">autoimmune hepatitis like appearance</d>, but to date there have been few reports.
<timex3 type="date">Here</timex3> we report a case of <d certainty="positive">acute hepatic impairment</d> caused by <m-key state="executed">pembrolizumab</m-key>.
Case Report: A male <timex3 type="age">in his 60s</timex3>.
In <timex3 type="date">November 201X</timex3> the patient was given a diagnosis of <f>Stage 4</f> <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d> with <d certainty="positive">bone metastasis</d>.
<d certainty="positive">PD-L1</d> <c>expression</c> was confirmed.
A course of <m-key state="executed">pembrolizumab</m-key> was started at <m-val>200 mg</m-val> for <timex3 type="duration">every 3 weeks</timex3> <timex3 type="date">in December</timex3>.
<t-key>AST</t-key> and <t-key>ALT</t-key> values were <t-val>44 IU/L</t-val> and <t-val>63 IU/L</t-val>, respectively.
Treatment was given in <timex3 type="med">4 courses</timex3>.
<t-test state="executed">Blood samples taken</t-test> <timex3 type="med">at the end of the fifth course</timex3> had results of: <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>120 IU/L</t-val> and <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>176 IU/L</t-val>.
The <r state="negated">administration</r> of the medicine was stopped.
However, <timex3 type="date">afterwards</timex3> the patient was <cc state="executed">hospitalized</cc> due to a <c>greater level</c> of <d certainty="positive">liver dysfunction</d> combined with <d certainty="positive">decreased appetite</d>.
<t-key>Height</t-key> <t-val>163 cm</t-val>, <t-key>Weight</t-key> <t-val>66 kg</t-val>.
<d certainty="negative">Abdominal findings</d> were unremarkable.
<timex3 type="med">On admission</timex3> the lab results were: <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>1361 IU/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>1593 IU/L</t-val>, <t-key>T-Bil </t-key> <t-val>1.1 mg/dL</t-val>, <t-key>IgG</t-key> <t-val>1027 mg/dl</t-val>.
<t-key>PT</t-key> <t-val>81%</t-val>, <t-key>M2BPGi</t-key> <t-val>1.06</t-val>, <t-key>ANA</t-key> <t-val>40x</t-val>, <d certainty="negative">HCV antibody</d> negative, <d certainty="negative">HBsAg</d> negative.
<t-test state="executed">Echocardiography</t-test> revealed no <d certainty="negative">fatty liver, atrophy or ascites</d>.
Pathological findings: <f>extensive</f> <d certainty="positive">hepatocyte shedding, hemorrhage, and infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells</d> <a>around the central vein</a>.
There was <d certainty="positive">spotty necrosis</d> <a>in the lobules</a> and <f>mild</f> <d certainty="positive">lymphoplasmacytic infiltration</d> <a>in the portal region</a>.
<timex3 type="med">After treatment</timex3> (<m-val>1000 mg</m-val> of <m-key state="executed">methylprednisolone</m-key>) <timex3 type="duration">for 3 days</timex3>, <t-key>AST</t-key> and <t-key>ALT</t-key> levels <c>improved</c> to <t-val>270 IU/L</t-val> and <t-val>822 IU/L</t-val> respectively.
<timex3 type="time">Thereafter</timex3>, <m-key state="executed">prednisolone</m-key> <m-val>1 mg/kg/day</m-val> was started, which was <c>gradually tapered off</c>, and <t-key>AST/ALT</t-key> levels reached the <f>baseline</f> in <timex3 type="date">approximately 2 months time</timex3>.
Discussion: One of the characteristics of <m-key state="other">immune checkpoint inhibitors</m-key> is their efficacy continues even after the medication is <timex3 type="med">no longer administered</timex3>, such that <p>their efficacy against the tumor</p> will continue.
On the other hand, it has also been remarked that <d certainty="general">irAEs</d> also persist over time.
<d certainty="general">Drug-induced hepatic impairment</d> of the <f>hepatocellular damage type</f> will usually see <c>quick resolution</c> of the <d certainty="general">liver disorder</d> by discontinuing the causative drug, but there have been cases of <c>exacerbation</c> even <timex3 type="med">after discontinuing</timex3> <m-key state="other">immune checkpoint inhibitors</m-key>.
In this case, <timex3 type="med">after discontinuing the medication</timex3>, the <d certainty="positive">liver enzymes level</d> <f>increased rapidly</f>.
It is essential to perform a <t-test state="other">liver biopsy</t-test> at an early stage to confirm the diagnosis, and then to begin <m-key state="other">steroids</m-key> as soon as possible.

Case Study: <timex3 type="age">53 year old</timex3> female patient.
Chief Complaint: <d certainty="positive">Fever</d>.
Progress: Patient was <cc state="executed">seen</cc> at the dermatology department of our hospital <timex3 type="date">2 years before 20XX</timex3> and presented a <d certainty="positive">skin rash</d> that the diagnosis identified as <d certainty="positive">bullous pemphigoid</d>.
<m-key state="executed">Prednisolone (PSL)</m-key> <m-val>1 mg/kg/day</m-val> was introduced and the patient <timex3 type="time">was</timex3> managed with concomitant <m-key state="executed">immunomodulators</m-key> with <c>a gradual decrease</c> in the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> level.
<m-key state="negated">PSL</m-key> was voluntarily discontinued in <timex3 type="date">August, 20XX</timex3> when the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> dosage had been <c>reduced</c> to <m-val>6 mg/day</m-val>, but there was no <d certainty="negative">worsening of the skin rash</d>.
<timex3 type="date">On September 9</timex3>, she felt a <d certainty="positive">malaise</d>, and <timex3 type="date">on September 10 </timex3> she <c>developed</c> a <d certainty="positive">fever</d> of <f>38°C</f>.
She was <cc state="executed">seen</cc> at our clinic.
The patient was admitted to our department as an <cc state="executed">emergency</cc> case because she presented <d certainty="positive">elevated bilirubin levels</d> with <f>direct type predominance</f>, a <c>mildly decreased</c> <t-key>PT</t-key> of <t-val>74%</t-val>, and <t-test state="executed">CT</t-test> findings suggestive of <d certainty="suspicious">acute hepatitis</d>.
The patient resumed <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> at the <m-val>same dosage</m-val> as when she voluntarily stopped taking the medication and was also started on <m-key state="executed">CMZ</m-key> for a suspected <d certainty="suspicious">infection</d>.
<t-key>Liver function</t-key> <c>showed improvement</c>, but the <t-key>eosinophils</t-key> <f>slowly</f> <c>increased</c>, and <d certainty="positive">erythema</d> <c>broke out</c> <a>all over her body</a>.
Her <d certainty="positive">skin rash</d> was <f>different</f> from the original <d certainty="positive">pemphigus</d>, and was suspected to be a <d certainty="suspicious">skin eruption</d> caused by the <m-key state="executed">CMZ</m-key>.
The <m-key state="negated">antibacterial medication</m-key> was stopped as of <timex3 type="date">September 17</timex3>.
Although the underlying cause of the disorder was not <f>clear</f>, <c>her fever abated</c> <f>gradually</f>.
Despite the persistence of <d certainty="positive">eosinophilia</d> it was decided to <cc state="executed">discharge</cc> the patient on <timex3 type="date">September 24</timex3>.
However, <timex3 type="date">2 days later</timex3> <d certainty="positive">the fever</d> once <f>again</f> <c>presented</c> itself, and as the patient <c>showed no improvement</c>, she was <cc state="executed">readmitted</cc> to the hospital on <timex3 type="date">October 1</timex3>.
<timex3 type="med">After readmission</timex3>, the patient showed <f>sudden</f> <d certainty="positive">prolongation of coagulation, hematopenia and the progression of jaundice</d>, and was diagnosed as having <d certainty="positive">non-comatose acute liver failure</d>.
After confirming that there were no contraindications for <m-key state="other">PSL</m-key> such as <d certainty="negative">a bacterial infection or malignancy</d>, <r state="executed">PSL pulse therapy</r> was started <timex3 type="date">on October 6</timex3> to treat the <d certainty="positive">acute liver failure</d>.
<timex3 type="med">After the start of</timex3> <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key>, the patient's <c>fever dropped</c> <f>quickly</f> and <t-key>liver function</t-key> <c>improved</c>.
The <t-key>eosinophil</t-key> level had not <c>dropped</c> and the <t-key>neutrophils</t-key> level was at (<t-val>100/ul</t-val>).
It was also <f>clear</f> that the <d certainty="positive">reduced level of neutrophils</d> was <c>persisting</c>.
However, the <t-test state="executed">bone marrow biopsy</t-test> revealed <t-key>no abnormalities in the hematopoiesis</t-key>.
<timex3 type="med">After tapering off</timex3> the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> no <d certainty="negative">liver injury or recurrence of fever</d> was observed and <d certainty="positive">blood cell reduction</d> <c>improved</c> over the course of <timex3 type="duration">approximately one month</timex3>.

<t-test state="executed">Various blood tests, imaging studies and histological examinations</t-test> were performed, but the results were negative for <d certainty="negative">infection, including parasites, blood flow disorders, autoimmune diseases, neoplastic lesions and hematological diseases</d>.
Histologically, <a>perivascular</a> <d certainty="positive">infiltrates, mainly eosinophils</d>, were observed in the <a>liver and skin</a>, but a diagnosis of <d certainty="negative">vasculitis</d> was not reached, and both were judged to be <d certainty="positive">secondary changes</d>.

Case Report: Patient is a <timex3 type="age">68 year old</timex3> male.
<timex3 type="med">During treatment</timex3> for a <d certainty="positive">myocardial infarction</d>, the patient presented symptoms of <d certainty="positive">somnolence</d> and <d certainty="positive">hyperammonemia</d> (<t-val>193 μg/dL</t-val> - <t-test state="executed">blood test</t-test> result).
The T1-weighted <t-test state="executed">head MRI</t-test> showed <d certainty="positive">high signal intensity</d> in the <a>bilateral globus pallidus</a>, and the patient was diagnosed having <d certainty="positive">impaired consciousness caused by hepatic encephalopathy</d>.

Discussion: This case of <d certainty="positive">hepatic encephalopathy</d> occurred <c>suddenly</c> without evidence of any underlying <a>liver</a> <d certainty="negative">disease</d>.
However, use of an <t-test state="executed">abdominal echo and contrast CT scan</t-test> made possible an immediate diagnosis and appropriate course of treatment.
<d certainty="general">Hepatic encephalopathy</d> has been reported to be caused by <d certainty="general">portal venous shunts associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension</d>, <d certainty="general">acquired metabolic imbalance</d> of the <a>urea cycle</a>, as well as other causes.
As in this case, the disease may be due to <d certainty="positive">portal venous shunts without liver disease</d>, although in such a case, an <d certainty="general">intrahepatic portal vein shunt</d> being the proximate cause is rare.
If there is a history of <d certainty="general">trauma</d> or <t-test state="other">liver biopsy</t-test> the cause is presumed to be <f>acquired</f>.
The patient had no previous medical history except for an <d certainty="positive">acute myocardial infarction</d>, which was considered <f>congenital</f>.
There have been reports of <d certainty="general">hepatic encephalopathy</d> being diagnosed asymptomatically or only first detected in geriatric patients, and this should be kept in mind as a differential factor for <d certainty="general">hepatic encephalopathy</d> in patients with <f>non-cirrhotic liver</f>.
Conclusion: Successful <r state="executed">percutaneous transhepatic obliteration</r> involving <d certainty="positive">hepatic encephalopathy caused by an intrahepatic portal vein-hepatic vein shunt</d>.

Current Medical History &amp; Clinical Progress: The patient was treated with <m-key state="executed">DCV + ASV</m-key> for <d certainty="positive">cirrhosis of the liver, type C</d> in <timex3 type="date">one year before 20XX</timex3> and was judged to have <c>SVR</c>.
<timex3 type="date">Thereafter</timex3>, a treatment strategy of <cc state="executed">regularly scheduled follow-up visits</cc> was adopted.
<timex3 type="date">On December 11, one year before 20XX</timex3> a <r state="executed">TAVI</r> procedure was performed for <d certainty="positive">aortic valve stenosis</d>.
The procedure went smoothly, but <timex3 type="med">post-operative</timex3> the patient began to experience <d certainty="positive">impaired consciousness and hyperammonemia</d>.
The patient was <cc state="executed">transferred to another hospital</cc> <timex3 type="date">on January 8,  20XX</timex3> for <timex3 type="med">post-operative</timex3> rehabilitation, but at this hospital she had <f>another</f> episode of <d certainty="positive">impaired consciousness and hyperammonemia</d>.
It was felt that the patient was <c>responding well</c> to <r state="executed">conservative treatment</r>.
However, during the <timex3 type="med">course</timex3> of treatment the patient <c>presented</c> both <d certainty="positive">edema and dyspnea</d>.
Based on a diagnosis of an <d certainty="positive">acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure</d> the patient was <cc state="executed">transferred</cc> to the Department of Cardiology at our hospital.
A <m-key state="executed">diuretic</m-key> was administered and the <d certainty="positive">heart failure</d> <c>showed improvement</c>, however a recurrence of the <d certainty="positive">hyperammonemia</d> was <c>observed</c>.
<timex3 type="date">From then on</timex3>, and in holding true to the objective of pursuing a conservative course of treatment, it was decided to <cc state="executed">transfer</cc> the patient to another department after we completed a thorough examination.
The <t-key>hepatic reserve</t-key> was <f>comparatively good</f> <timex3 type="med">after SVR</timex3>, with a <t-val>Child Pugh grade A (6 points)</t-val>.
On the <a>stomach, spleen left renal vein</a> was found a <d certainty="positive">portosystemic shunt</d>; this <d certainty="positive">shunt</d>, in combination with the <d certainty="positive">cirrhosis</d>, had a significant effect.
<timex3 type="date">At this juncture</timex3>, while continuing to treat for <d certainty="positive">heart failure</d>, the risk of repeated <d certainty="suspicious">hepatic encephalopathy</d> was judged high, and we decided to perform a <r state="scheduled">percutaneous transhepatic obliteration</r>.
<r state="executed">Percutaneous transhepatic obliteration</r> was performed <timex3 type="date">on March 1</timex3>.
The procedure was executed without any difficulty, and the patient recovered without any <f>major</f> <timex3 type="med">post-operative</timex3> <d certainty="negative">complications</d>.
The <timex3 type="med">postoperative</timex3> <t-key>blood ammonia level</t-key> <c>quickly normalized</c>, <timex3 type="date">and</timex3> there was no <d certainty="negative">concurrent complication due to encephalopathy</d>.
Discussion: Although <d certainty="general">hepatic encephalopathy</d> is a phenotype of <d certainty="general">uncompensated liver cirrhosis</d>, aggressive treatment is indicated because it decreases a patients' QOL and can greatly degrade their dignity.
Medical treatment includes restriction of protein intake and oral or intravenous administration of <m-key state="other">lactulose or branched-chain amino acid preparations</m-key>.
<timex3 type="date">Recently</timex3>, the therapeutic usefulness of <m-key state="other">rifaximin and L-Carnitine preparations</m-key>, which are non-absorbable antibiotics, has been reported.
If it is determined that<d certainty="general">cirrhosis</d> is the <c>clear cause</c> of a <d certainty="general">portosystemic shunt</d>, treatment may prove difficult.
In such cases, <r state="other">retrograde transvenous embolization under balloon occlusion, portal vein diversion or percutaneous transhepatic obliteration</r> are the treatments of choice, with improvement usually being the outcome.
However, in some cases, <d certainty="general">ascites and varicose vein exacerbation</d> have been reported.
In this case, strict <r state="executed">fluid management</r> was necessary due to <d certainty="positive">heart failure</d>, and <r state="executed">shunt obliteration</r> was indicated because the patient had easily developed <d certainty="positive">encephalopathy</d> due to <d certainty="positive">dehydration</d>.
<timex3 type="med">After the treatment</timex3> the prognosis has remained positive, and even with further treatment later on, no <d certainty="negative">recurrence of encephalopathy</d> has been observed.

Background: In Japan the <r state="other">balloon-occluded retrogade transvenous obliteration (BRTO)</r> procedure is often performed for the treatment of <d certainty="general">gastric varices associated with cirrhosis</d>, and is recommended in the Guidelines for the Treatment of Cirrhosis 2015.
On the other hand, <r state="other">partial splenic artery embolization, hereinafter known as PSE</r> is a treatment method that can reduce <a>splenic</a> volume, correct <d certainty="general">splenic hyperplasia</d>, and <c>improve</c> <t-key>portal pressure</t-key> and <t-key>hepatic function</t-key> by <f>partially</f> <r state="other">embolizing</r> the <a>splenic artery</a>.
<timex3 type="date">Here</timex3> we report a case involving <d certainty="positive">alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by gastric varices</d> with <d certainty="positive">giant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia</d> involvement for which <r state="executed">PSE</r> was performed as part of prior therapy and <r state="executed">BRTO</r> was performed as a wait-and-see treatment.
We are able to report that the result was an <c>improvement</c> both for <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d> and <t-key>hepatic function</t-key>.
Case Report: Male patient <timex3 type="age">in his 70s</timex3>.
The patient was <timex3 type="med">receiving treatment</timex3> for <d certainty="positive">alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver</d> from his local physician at the time he was referred to our department <timex3 type="date">in 20XX</timex3> for the treatment of <d certainty="positive">esophageal varices</d>.
<t-test state="executed">Upper endoscopy</t-test> revealed <d certainty="positive">esophageal varices</d> (<f>Lm, F3, Cb, RC0</f>) and <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d> (<f>Lg-cf, F1, RC0</f>).
<r state="executed">Endoscopic sclerotherapy for varicose veins</r> was given, and the <d certainty="positive">esophageal varicose veins</d> <c>disappeared</c>, so the patient's <cc state="executed">follow up</cc> was handled on an outpatient basis.
<timex3 type="set">Periodic</timex3> <t-test state="executed">upper endoscopy and abdominal imaging examinations</t-test> were given at the <cc state="executed">outpatient clinic</cc>.
The <d certainty="positive">esophageal varices</d> <c>did not worsen</c>, but the number of <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d> <f>gradually</f> <c>increased (Fl→F2</c>).
<t-test state="executed">Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen</t-test> showed <d certainty="positive">giant splenomegaly, a splenic renal shunt</d>, and <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d> <f>protruding</f> into the <a>gastric lumen</a>.
Furthermore, <d certainty="positive">hypersplenism coupled with a low platelet count</d> (<t-val>50,000-70,000/μl</t-val>) and <d certainty="positive">hyperammonemia</d> (<t-val>around 100 mg/dl</t-val> were also observed.
Therefore, we decided to improve splenic function by first performing a <r state="scheduled">PSE</r> and then treating the <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d> with the <r state="scheduled">BRTO</r> procedure.
<timex3 type="date">3 years after 20XX</timex3>, an <r state="executed">embolism</r> using the <r state="executed">PSE</r> procedure was performed on <f>approximately 80%</f> of the entire <a>spleen</a>, centering on the <a>inferior polar branch of the splenic artery</a>.
The <t-key>platelet count</t-key>, <timex3 type="med">prior to treatment</timex3>, was at <t-val>73,000/μl</t-val>; <timex3 type="date">approximately one month</timex3> post treatment the <t-key>platelet</t-key> count had <c>increased</c> to <t-val>158,000/μl</t-val>, clear evidence of reversal of the <d certainty="positive">hypersplenism</d>.
Subsequently, <r state="executed">BRTO</r> was performed on the <d certainty="positive">gastrorenal shunt</d> flowing into the <a>left adrenal vein</a>.
<t-test state="executed">Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)</t-test> revealed a <c>lack of blood flow</c> to the <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d>.
<timex3 type="date">2 months later</timex3> <t-test state="executed">upper endoscopy</t-test> revealed the <d certainty="positive">gastric varices</d> <c>had shrunk (Lg-cf, Fl, RC0)</c> and this fact, taken together with the new <t-key>platelet count</t-key> of <t-val>150,000/μl</t-val> and an<t-key>ammonia level</t-key> of <t-val>32 mg/dl</t-val>, allowed us to determine for an <c>improvement in hepatic function</c>.
Discussion and Conclusion: The results of this case suggest that <r state="executed">BRTO</r> can be performed more safely to <d certainty="positive">gastric varices associated with cirrhosis with marked hypersplenism</d> by preceding with a <r state="executed">PSE</r>, which may ultimately <c>improve hepatic function</c>.

Case Report: <timex3 type="age">70 year old</timex3>, female.
A case of <d certainty="positive">decompensated stage C cirrhosis</d> (<t-key>Child-Pugh score</t-key>: <t-val>8B</t-val>) with a <f>2 cm</f> <d certainty="positive">hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</d> at <a>S3</a>.
<f>Not being appropriate for excision</f>, we considered <r state="negated">percutaneous localized therapy</r>, but given that an <d certainty="positive">extrahepatic shunt</d> had developed from the <a>umbilical vein</a> and occupied the <a>anterior surface of the left lateral lobes</a>, it was not considered safe for needle puncture.
The patient was referred to a certain hospital for the objective of <r state="scheduled">shunt occlusion</r>, judging that if the <r state="other">shunt occlusion</r> was successful, not only could <r state="other">localized therapy</r> be safely managed, but also <t-key>liver function</t-key> could be <c>restored</c> and <r state="other">antiviral therapy</r> could be administered.
At a joint conference of the Department of Surgery, Internal Medicine, and Radiology, it was decided to perform a <r state="scheduled">percutaneous transsplenic umbilical vein occlusion</r> and <r state="scheduled">splenic artery embolization</r>.
However, <timex3 type="med">during the surgery</timex3> <d certainty="positive">intra-abdominal bleeding due to a splenic vein injury</d> developed, and an <r state="executed">emergency splenectomy and umbilical vein ligation</r> were performed.
<timex3 type="med">Post surgery</timex3>, the <d certainty="negative">shunt</d> at the <a>anterior surface of the extrahepatic area</a> <c>disappeared</c> and <t-key>liver function</t-key> <c>improved</c> to a <t-val>Child A</t-val> level.
<r state="executed">Percutaneous microwave ablation</r> was performed.
The patient was <timex3 type="date">then</timex3> treated with <r state="executed">sofosbuvir and regipasvir</r> and achieved <c>SVR</c>.
<timex3 type="time">As of now</timex3>, <timex3 type="med">18 months have already elapsed since the operation</timex3> <c>without recurrence</c> of <d certainty="negative">HCC</d>, and <t-key>liver function</t-key> remains <t-val>good</t-val>.
Discussion: In <d certainty="general">cirrhotic</d> patients the development of <d certainty="general">portal-major circulatory shunts</d> is a cause of <d certainty="general">shunted hepatic encephalopathy and decreased liver function</d>.
<r state="other">Shunt occlusion</r> is a highly effective treatment that not only <c>reduces</c> <t-key>serum ammonia levels</t-key> but also <c>improves liver function</c>.
Although less invasive <r state="other">transcatheter therapy</r> such as <r state="other">BRTO</r> should be considered as the first choice rather than <r state="other">laparotomy</r> for <r state="other">shunt ligation</r>, in this case, a <r state="negated">transcatheter approach</r> to the treating of the <d certainty="positive">shunt</d> proved difficult, and because of <d certainty="positive">bleeding complications</d> associated with the procedure, <r state="executed">extrahepatic shunt ligation and splenectomy</r> by <r state="executed">laparotomy</r> was undertaken as an alternate treatment strategy.
In terms of a result, <timex3 type="med">after the operation</timex3>, <r state="executed">percutaneous localized therapy</r> could be safely administered, <t-key>liver function</t-key> <c>improved</c>, and <r state="executed">antiviral therapy</r> could also be administered.
Therefore, if a <r state="negated">transcatheter approach</r> to the treatment of the <d certainty="positive">shunt</d> is difficult, as was in this case, <r state="executed">laparotomy</r> should be considered.

However, in <timex3 type="date">December, 20XX</timex3>, it was noted that his <t-key>γ-GTP</t-key> level was <f>slightly</f> elevated.
The patient was referred to our department after the imaging requested by his treating physician who had suggested there was an <d certainty="suspicious">obstruction</d> of the <a>middle hepatic vein</a>.
In <timex3 type="date">May, 20XX</timex3>, the patient was <cc state="executed">admitted</cc> to our hospital for the objective of further examination.
At the <timex3 type="med">time of admission</timex3>, although the physical examination yielded nothing remarkable, the <t-test state="executed">blood test</t-test> indicated a <d certainty="positive">considerably elevated γ-GTP level</d> (<t-val>79 IU/L</t-val>).
No other abnormalities were found for the blood count, coagulation test, or biochemical findings.
A <t-test state="executed">dynamic computed tomography of the abdomen</t-test> revealed a <f>large</f> <d certainty="positive">right diaphragmatic hernia</d> with <f>protrusion</f> of the <a>right lobe of the liver, gallbladder, and hepatic flexure of the colon</a> into the <a>thoracic cavity</a>.
In particular, the <d certainty="positive">hernia portal</d> <f>considerably</f> <d certainty="positive">excluded</d> the <a>inside of the hepatic hilum of the right lobe of the liver</a>.
The <a>right hepatic vein</a> was <d certainty="positive">stenotic</d>, the <a>middle hepatic vein</a> was <d certainty="positive">obstructed</d> and the <a>reflux area of the middle hepatic vein</a> was <f>highly</f> <d certainty="positive">atrophic</d>.
The <a>subhepatic vena cava</a> had no <f>obvious</f> <d certainty="negative">point of origin for obstruction</d>.
The <t-test state="executed">MRCP examination</t-test> revealed that the <a>bile ducts</a> were <d certainty="positive">obscured</d> <a>at the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts</a>, and the <a>intrahepatic bile ducts</a> were <d certainty="positive">slightly dilated</d> in <a>both lobes</a>.
<t-test state="executed">Transarterial portal venography (CT)</t-test> revealed <f>heterogeneous</f> staining of the <a>right lobe of the liver</a>, suggesting <d certainty="suspicious">congestive hepatopathy</d>.
The <a>middle hepatic vein</a> <f>could not be identified</f>.
Late phase of <t-test state="executed">hepatic arteriographic CT scan</t-test> showed the <d certainty="positive">development of a venous short circuit</d>.
The <t-key>hepatic venous wedge pressure</t-key>, when <t-test state="executed">measured</t-test>, was <t-val>10 mmHg</t-val>, which is within the normal range.
<t-test state="executed">Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy</t-test> showed no <d certainty="negative">varices</d> in the <a>esophagus or stomach</a>.
<t-test state="executed">Chest X-rays and abdominal CT scans</t-test> taken <timex3 type="misc">after the traffic accident</timex3> <timex3 type="date">5 years before 20XX</timex3> were once again reviewed.
We <c>found</c> a <a>partial hepatic</a> <f>prolapse</f> from the <d certainty="positive">right diaphragmatic hernia</d> into the <a>thoracic cavity</a>, which was not seen in the <t-test state="executed">chest X-ray</t-test> of <timex3 type="date">9 years before 20XX</timex3>.
The <timex3 type="date">subsequent</timex3> course the disease might take was unknown, but the <d certainty="positive">hernia portal</d> <f>gradually</f> <c>opened</c> and the volume of the <f>enlarged</f> <a>liver</a> <c>increased</c>.
The <a>right and middle hepatic veins</a> were <f>mechanically</f> <d certainty="positive">drained</d>, resulting in hemodynamics <f>similar to the Budd-Chiari syndrome (type IV)</f>, and thus the patient was diagnosed as having Budd-Chiari syndrome (type IV).
Since there is concern that the condition may <c>worsen</c> in <timex3 type="date">the future</timex3>, we are now considering <r state="scheduled">surgical repair of the diaphragm</r>.
We managed a case with hemodynamics <f>similar to the Budd-Chiari syndrome</f> hemodynamics <timex3 type="med">5 years after</timex3> the <d certainty="positive">diaphragmatic hernia</d> caused by a traffic accident.
A case of this nature is rare, not only in Japan but on a global scale, and we include striking imaging findings with our report.

<article id="JP0217-44" title="出血性ショックをきたした門脈血栓を伴う肝硬変の一例">
Objective: For patients with <d certainty="general">cirrhosis</d> who present <d certainty="general">hematemesis and melena</d>, we often find cases for which no obvious cause for the bleeding can be identified, even after performing an <t-test state="other">upper and lower endoscopy</t-test>.
Here we report a case of <d certainty="positive">cirrhosis</d> in which a patient died of <d certainty="positive">hemorrhagic shock</d> at our hospital, and the pathological autopsy revealed the cause of death as <d certainty="positive">portal hypertensive enteropathy induced by portal vein thrombosis</d>.
Case Study: Patient was an <timex3 type="age">81 year old</timex3> male with a history of <d certainty="positive">cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma</d>, who had been a <cc state="executed">patient</cc> at our hospital since <timex3 type="date">5 years before 20XX</timex3>.
He was found collapsed at home <timex3 type="date">in August 20XX</timex3> and was <cc state="executed">rushed</cc> to our hospital with a complaint of <d certainty="positive">decreased consciousness and a bloody bowel discharge</d> Clinical Progress: His <t-key>level of consciousness</t-key> was measured at <t-val>E4V5M6</t-val>.
The patient presented with a <d certainty="positive">low level of hematemesis</d>, but with a <f>considerable quantity</f> of <d certainty="positive">dark red stool</d>.
We suspected <d certainty="suspicious">upper gastrointestinal bleeding</d> and performed repeated <t-test state="executed">endoscopic examinations</t-test>, but no obvious source of bleeding could be identified.
The <timex3 type="date">same day</timex3>, taking into consideration the <d certainty="suspicious">rupture of the esophageal varices</d> and possible <timex3 type="med">hemostatis</timex3>, the patient was given <r state="executed">EIS</r>.
On the <timex3 type="date">following day</timex3>, the patient presented without <d certainty="negative">hematemesis</d>, but on the <timex3 type="date">third day</timex3>, a <d certainty="positive">considerable quantity of tar feces was discharged</d> once more by the patient, <timex3 type="date">followed by</timex3> <d certainty="positive">respiratory arrest</d>.
Although <r state="executed">resuscitation</r> was attempted, the patient expired <c>without recovering</c>.
Discussion: The pathological autopsy found the <a>mucosa of the lower small to large intestine</a> to be <f>intermittently</f> <f>dark purple</f>, and a <f>considerable quantity</f> of <f>dark red</f> <d certainty="positive">bloody stool</d> was found <a>inside</a>, evidence of <d certainty="positive">lower gastrointestinal bleeding</d>.
Furthermore, <d certainty="positive">mild vasodilation and dilatation</d> of the <a>lower gastrointestinal mucosa</a> was discovered, suggesting <d certainty="suspicious">portal hypertensive enteropathy</d> was the cause of the lesion.
The <d certainty="positive">portal vein thrombus</d>, found in the <timex3 type="date">earlier</timex3> <t-test state="executed">CT scan</t-test>, extended into the <a>superior mesenteric vein</a>, suggesting that the <a>vein</a>'s <c>internal pressure increased</c> due to <d certainty="positive">portal hypertensive enteropathy</d>, which may have <c>further increased internal pressure</c>, resulting in <d certainty="suspicious">lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to a diffuse hemorrhage</d>.
Conclusion: <d certainty="general">Portal hypertensive enteropathy</d> has no characteristic endoscopic or pathological findings and there are currently no uniform diagnostic criteria or severity classification available.
It is also difficult to diagnose <d certainty="general">thrombosis</d> because of nonspecific symptoms, and it has been reported that in 75% of the cases that <timex3 type="duration">48 hours</timex3> elapsed from the time the symptoms first appeared to a diagnosis being made.
For patients with <d certainty="general">portal hypertension</d> coupled with<d certainty="general">thrombosis</d> who <d certainty="general">present blood</d> in the stool, it is important to differentiate between a <d certainty="general">massive bloody discharge</d> due to <d certainty="general">diffuse bleeding</d> from the <a>lower gastrointestinal tract</a> and thrombosis, and to consider the priority and necessity of additional tests and treatment as soon as <d certainty="general">thrombosis</d> develops in patients with <d certainty="general">portal hypertensive disease</d>.

Lab Results: <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>66 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>50 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALP</t-key> <t-val>1025 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>γ-GTP</t-key> <t-val>335 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>T-Bil</t-key> <t-val>1.4 mg/dl</t-val>, <t-key>Plt</t-key> <t-val>20.6x104/ul</t-val>, <t-key>PT</t-key> <t-val>103%</t-val>, <d certainty="negative">HBs antigen</d> (-), <d certainty="negative">HCV antibody</d> (-), <t-key>anti-nuclear antibody</t-key> <t-val>×160</t-val>, <t-key>anti-mitochondrial antibody</t-key> <t-val>×80</t-val>, <t-key>anti-mitochondrial M2 index</t-key> <t-val>88.5</t-val>, <t-key>IgG</t-key> <t-val>1923 mg/dl</t-val> <t-key>IgM</t-key> <t-val>523 mg/dl</t-val>.
Clinical Course: <t-test state="executed">Contrast-enhanced CT and abdominal ultrasonography</t-test> indicated that the <a>surface of the liver</a> was <f>uneven and irregular</f> with <d certainty="positive">blunted</d> <f>margins</f> confirming<d certainty="positive">cirrhosis</d>.
There was no <f>obvious</f> <d certainty="negative">evidence of organic disease</d> in the <a>liver or bile ducts</a>.
We suspected <d certainty="suspicious">primary biliary cholangitis</d> based on the <t-test state="executed">blood test</t-test> and <t-test state="executed">imaging</t-test> results.
A <t-test state="executed">liver biopsy</t-test> was taken, the pathological findings of <t-test state="executed">which</t-test> showed a <f>moderate</f> to <d certainty="positive">severe infiltration of inflammatory cells</d>, <f>mainly lymphocytes</f>, in the <a>portal vein and sinusoids</a>.
In <f>part</f> of the <a>portal vein region</a>, <d certainty="positive">lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltrates</d> were found in the <a>bile duct epithelium</a> as well as <d certainty="positive">ductular proliferation</d> in <f>some areas</f>.
<t-test state="executed">Azan</t-test> staining revealed <d certainty="positive">bridging fibrosis</d> in <f>some</f> areas.
Based on the findings of the <t-test state="executed">blood tests</t-test> and histopathological images the patient was diagnosed as having chronic <d certainty="positive">non-pyogenic destructive cholangitis</d> and <d certainty="positive">symptomatic primary cholangitis</d>.
<m-key state="executed">Ursodeoxycholic acid</m-key> (<m-val>600 mg/day</m-val>) was started <timex3 type="med">once the diagnosis was made</timex3>.
The <t-key>hepatobiliary enzymes</t-key> <f>rapidly</f> <c>improved</c> <timex3 type="med">after the start of oral medication</timex3>.
Since then the patient has been under <cc state="executed">observation</cc> at our <cc state="executed">outpatient</cc> clinic without any <d certainty="negative">relapse</d>.
Discussion: The distribution of <d certainty="general">primary biliary cholangitis</d> by subject's age and estimated age of onset, when segregated by sex, is overwhelmingly higher in women, with most <c>cases occurring</c> between the ages of <timex3 type="age">45</timex3> and <timex3 type="age">60</timex3>.
The <c>incidence rate</c> for those in the population who are <timex3 type="age">over the age of 65</timex3> is approximately 12%, and as in this case, less than 2% for those <timex3 type="age">over the age of 75</timex3>, which makes it rare.
On the whole, the cumulative incidence of carcinogenesis is relatively low (2.5% at <timex3 type="med">10 years after diagnosis</timex3>) for <d certainty="general">primary cholangitis</d>.
However, it is significantly higher in males at 6.5% versus in females at 2.0% (6.5% in males and 2.0% in females).
Furthermore, for men <timex3 type="age">over the age of 70</timex3>, with a history of blood transfusion, it has been reported that the risk of cancer is exacerbated, so that <t-test state="other">screening</t-test> is necessary.
In <timex3 type="date">recent years</timex3>, the average age for the onset of cholangitis has been rising, including those of the population who are of advanced years.
It is important to realize there is a possibility of <d certainty="general">primary biliary cholangitis</d> when <d certainty="general">elevated hepatobiliary enzymes</d> are detected, even for patients of highly advanced years, and to recognize the need to perform a thorough examination.
Conclusion: Here we report a rare, single case involving a geriatric male patient who was diagnosed with <d certainty="positive">primary biliary cholangitis</d>.

<t-test state="executed">Abdominal US</t-test> revealed a <d certainty="positive">fatty liver</d>, and the <t-test state="executed">blood tests</t-test> suggested <d certainty="positive">liver damage</d>.
Lab Results: <t-key>AST</t-key> <t-val>51 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>ALT</t-key> <t-val>109 U/L</t-val>, <t-key>γ-GTP</t-key> <t-val>34</t-val>, <t-key>CHE </t-key> <t-val>447 U/L</t-val>, <d certainty="negative">Hepatitis virus markers, ANA and AMA-M2Ab were negative</d>.
However, <t-key>serum ceruloplasmin </t-key> tested at <t-val>13 mg/dl</t-val> and <t-key>serum copper</t-key> tested at <t-val> 55 μg/dl</t-val>; both <c>below</c> the normal range.
<t-key>Urinary copper</t-key> tested at <t-val>72.8 μg/day</t-val>, which was <f>higher than the reference value</f>.
With a possibility of <d certainty="suspicious">Wilson's Disease</d> <cc state="executed">additional tests</cc> were ordered.

<a>Liver histology</a> showed a <d certainty="positive">diffuse fatty liver</d>, and the <t-key>copper level in the liver tissue</t-key> was at <t-val>70.5 μg/g</t-val> dry weight, which was <f>higher</f> than the reference value (&lt;50 μg/g dry weight), but not high enough to confirm a diagnosis of <d certainty="suspicious">Wilson's Disease</d>.
However, <t-key>copper</t-key> is <f>not uniformly present</f> in <a>liver tissues</a>, and the <t-key>copper level</t-key> varies depending on the <a>sampling site</a>.
We fully explained the situation to the patient and his family, and consent was given to perform an <t-test state="executed">ATP-7B gene test</t-test>, however no <d certainty="negative">mutation</d> was found.
Based on the test results, in our consideration we believe it is <f>unlikely</f> that this is a case of <d certainty="suspicious">Wilson's disease</d>.
However, since <d certainty="general">genetic mutations</d> have not been identified in more than 10% of cases involving <d certainty="general">Wilson's disease</d>, we are following the patient's progress through <cc state="executed">regular follow-up</cc> visits as there is the possibility of <d certainty="suspicious">heterozygosity</d>.
Discussion: In the <timex3 type="misc">early stages of the disease and in the chronic hepatitis stage</timex3>, <d certainty="general">Wilson's disease</d> is known to present as <d certainty="general">fatty liver or fatty hepatitis</d>, and in our department, the diagnosis of <d certainty="general">Wilson's disease</d> is often made based on a diagnosis of <d certainty="general">fatty liver</d>.
The patient also had <d certainty="positive">fatty liver</d>, <c>decreased</c> <t-key>serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper</t-key> levels and an <d certainty="positive">increased level of urinary copper</d>, so a <t-test state="executed">Penicillamine Challenge Test, copper level measurement in the liver tissue</t-test> were carried out.
However, none of the tests results were <f>beyond the normal range</f> and did not support a diagnosis of <d certainty="suspicious">Wilson's disease</d>, nor were any <d certainty="negative">genetic mutations</d> found.
<timex3 type="time">At this juncture</timex3>, although we think it <f>very unlikely</f> in this case that it is <d certainty="suspicious">Wilson's disease</d>, it is to be admitted that it is often overlooked by physicians without sufficient awareness of the <d certainty="general">disease</d>.
Therefore, when treating patients with <d certainty="general">hepatic disorders and fatty liver disease</d>, it is important to make a separate assessment regarding the possibility of <d certainty="general">Wilson's disease</d>.

Although this will help more patients in their struggle to eliminate the virus, it will also require greater focus on the <c>possibility</c> of an <d certainty="general">adverse outcome</d> <timex3 type="med">during treatment</timex3> due to the many <d certainty="general">complications of the disease</d>.
The purpose of <timex3 type="date">this study</timex3> was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of <m-key state="executed">SOF/VEL</m-key> in patients with <d certainty="positive">decompensated liver cirrhosis type C</d> being treated at our hospital.
Method: Study 6 patients diagnosed with <d certainty="positive">decompensated cirrhosis type C</d>, being treated with <m-key state="executed">SOF/VEL</m-key>, taking into consideration both the clinical background and course of treatment for each.
Distribution: 6 patients (2 male, 4 female) who were given <m-key state="executed">SOF/VEL</m-key>.

Background: Helicobacter cinaedi (H. cinaedi) is a gram-negative helical rod bacterium that was discovered in the 1980s.
This bacteria inhabits both the intestine and liver.
It has been isolated from <a>intestine and liver blood</a> samples of patients who are immuno <c>compromised</c>, either due to some <d certainty="general">underlying disease</d> or a course of <r state="other">chemotherapy</r>.
<timex3 type="date">Here</timex3>, we report a case of <d certainty="positive">H. cinaedi bacteremia and cellulitis</d> associated with <d certainty="positive">decompensated cirrhosis</d>.
Case Report: <timex3 type="age">61-year-old</timex3> male with <d certainty="positive">decompensated cirrhosis, type C</d>.
The patient was <cc state="executed">admitted to the hospital</cc> with a complaint of <d certainty="positive">refractory hepatic ascites</d>, with an objective to <r state="scheduled">control the ascites</r>.
The <timex3 type="med">day before admission</timex3>, the patient had presented <f>brownish</f> <d certainty="positive">vomit</d> in addition to having <d certainty="positive">anemia</d> (level at <t-key>Hb</t-key> <t-val>7.4 g/dl</t-val>).
With the objective of performing a thorough examination an <t-test state="executed">upper gastrointestinal endoscopy</t-test> was undertaken.
As a result, although no <d certainty="negative">active bleeding</d> was observed, the patient did have <d certainty="positive">reflux esophagitis</d> <f>LA classification Grade C</f>, and <d certainty="suspicious">bleeding</d> from the same site was suspected.
<timex3 type="misc">After resumption of food intake</timex3> the patient no longer <d certainty="negative">vomited</d>, but due to a <d certainty="positive">decreased level of food intake</d> the <d certainty="positive">hypoalbuminemia</d> <c>progressed</c> and the <d certainty="positive">ascites</d> <c>again worsened</c>.
The <d certainty="positive">ascites</d> did <c>not improve</c> with the administration of <m-key state="executed">furosemide and spironolactone</m-key>, so that <m-key state="executed">tolvaptan</m-key> (<m-val>3.75 mg/day</m-val>) was started on the <timex3 type="date">7th day</timex3>.
On the <timex3 type="date">9th day</timex3>, the patient <c>developed</c> a <d certainty="positive">fever</d> of <f>38°C</f>, although without any physical symptoms.
The <d certainty="positive">fever</d> continued <c>intermittently</c> until the <timex3 type="date">14th day</timex3>, and on the <timex3 type="date">15th day</timex3>, symptoms of <d certainty="positive">bilateral lower leg pain, redness, warm sensations and swelling</d> <c>emerged</c>.
A <t-test state="executed">MRI of the lower leg</t-test> showed high signal intensity on the T2WI <a>along the fascia of both lower legs</a>, and a diagnosis was reached of <d certainty="positive">cellulitis</d>.
<t-test state="executed">Blood cultures</t-test> were taken on the <timex3 type="set">11th, 13th, and 15th days, counting from the onset of the illness</timex3>, to determine the causative organism, with H.
cinaedi being found in all cases.
The time it took to achieve <d certainty="positive">positive blood culture</d> ranged from <timex3 type="duration">113 to 150 hours</timex3>.
<m-key state="executed">Ceftriaxone</m-key> (<m-val>2 g/day</m-val>), which was started on the <timex3 type="date">15th day of the illness</timex3>, was continued for treating <d certainty="positive">bacteremia and cellulitis</d>, both of which are caused by the same organism.
Since the patient's symptoms had improved his medication was switched to <m-key state="executed">minocycline</m-key> (<m-val>200 mg/day</m-val>) on the <timex3 type="date">29th day of the illness</timex3>, and he was <cc state="executed">discharged</cc> on the <timex3 type="date">36th day of the illness</timex3>.
Discussion: In many cases, <d certainty="general">H. cinaedi infection</d> is detected in a <t-test state="other">blood culture</t-test> taken from patients who have either <d certainty="general">cellulitis or proctitis</d>.
However, an extended culture period of <timex3 type="duration">5 to 7 days</timex3>, or in some cases <timex3 type="duration">more than 10 days</timex3>, is required to achieve a <d certainty="general">positive culture</d> finding, and in some cases the culture may not prove positive within the normal incubation period.
Thus, if this organism is suspected, an extended time to process the blood culture should be requested.
Additionally, this infection has a high tendency to <d certainty="general">recur</d> <p>due to nosocomial infection or horizontal transmission,</p>as has been reported in the literature.
<timex3 type="date">This time</timex3>, as has been shown in this case report, H. cinaedi should be taken into consideration as the possible causative agent of <d certainty="positive">infections</d> in <d certainty="positive">immunocompromised</d> patients with <d certainty="positive">decompensated cirrhosis</d> and should be thoroughly investigated and treated.

Case Report: <timex3 type="age">43-year-old</timex3> female.
Chief Complaint: <d certainty="positive">Abnormal shadows</d> on the <t-test state="executed">chest MRI</t-test>.

No <d certainty="negative">other lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis findings</d> were found.
The surgical oncologist attempted to take a <t-test state="negated">biopsy</t-test> from the <a>intercostal space</a>, but the procedure was abandoned due to interference from the <a>right breast</a> <r state="executed">implant</r>.
The patient was referred to the Department of Respiratory Surgery for a <r state="executed">thoracoscopic excisional biopsy</r>.

After <timex3 type="duration">15 minutes</timex3> of observation with <a>bilateral</a> <r state="executed">lung ventilation</r>, it was judged that a <r state="negated">removal</r> of <a>lung</a> was unnecessary because there was no <d certainty="negative">color deficiency</d> in the <a>lungs</a>, nor did <d certainty="negative">vital changes or acidosis</d> <c>present</c>.
Since a <timex3 type="med">post</timex3>-<a>pneumonectomy</a> was not involved, it was determined that <r state="negated">lobar fixation</r> of the <a>lung</a> was unnecessary.
The patient's progress <timex3 type="med">after the second surgery</timex3> was encouraging.

Introduction: <d certainty="general">Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</d> is a condition in which <d certainty="general">blood clots form due to blood clotting</d> and occurs <a>in deep veins such as the femoral and common iliac veins</a>.
There have been surprisingly few reports of <d certainty="general">DVT</d> in children with <d certainty="general">severe mental or physical disabilities</d> (hereinafter referred to as "critically ill children") who have been <cc state="other">confined to bed for a long period of time</cc>, and the pathogenesis of DVT remains unclear, although the present authors reported a case to this Society in 2007.
In the <timex3 type="date">present study</timex3> we screened for <d certainty="general">DVT</d> in critically ill children.
Method: Case histories of 9 patients (3 males, 6 females) who were <cc state="executed">long-term residents</cc> at our center, and all of whom were classified as <t-key>Oshima classification</t-key> <t-val>1</t-val>, formed the basis of this study.
<t-test state="executed">Venous ultrasonography</t-test> was performed to evaluate <d certainty="general">DVT</d> in the <a>deep veins of the lower extremities</a>.
<t-test state="executed">Blood coagulation tests</t-test>, including <t-key>D-dimer</t-key>, were also taken.
The ethical concerns were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center.
Results: The subjects' ages <timex3 type="age">ranged from 10-55 years</timex3> (median age: <timex3 type="age">45 years</timex3>), and 2 of the 9 patients (22.2%) had <f>asymptomatic</f> <d certainty="positive">DVT</d>.
For both cases the site of the <d certainty="positive">DVT</d> was in the <a>left common femoral vein</a>.
The <a>soleal vein</a> was <d certainty="positive">underdeveloped</d>, and <d certainty="negative">thrombi</d> were not found in this region for all patients.
<t-test state="executed">Blood coagulation tests</t-test> revealed <d certainty="positive">elevated levels of antithrombin III, FDP, and D-dimer</d> in <f>some</f> patients, but these levels were within the reference range for all patients who had <d certainty="positive">clots</d>.
Discussion: <d certainty="general">DVTs</d> of the <a>pelvic and lower extremity veins</a>, depending on the generation site, can be divided into two groups: 1) <a>central side from the popliteal vein central</a>-(<f>central ilium and femoral type</f>), and 2) <a>peripheral side</a> <f>peripheral type (crus type)</f>.
<d certainty="general">DVT</d> is usually of the <f>peripheral type</f>, and the most common site of initial presentation is in the <a>soleal vein</a>.
However, as reported by Omori et al. (<timex3 type="date">2012</timex3>), the <a>veins</a> in this region are <d certainty="general">underdeveloped</d> in critically ill children, who are often <d certainty="general">bedridden from birth</d>, and <d certainty="general">DVT</d> occurs less frequently.
In the <timex3 type="date">present study</timex3>, both cases of <d certainty="positive">DVT</d> were of the <f>central type</f>, and in addition to <d certainty="positive">motor impairment</d> due to <cc state="executed">prolonged bed rest</cc>, <f>mild</f> <d certainty="positive">dehydration</d> from <d certainty="positive">sweating</d> due to <d certainty="positive">extreme muscle tension</d> was also inferred as a factor in the <d certainty="positive">thrombus formation</d>.
A study based on a larger number of cases is currently being undertaken by Omori et al.

<article id="JP0292-2" title="筋緊張のある人工呼吸器装着中の重症心身障害者の援助">
Introduction: Many pediatric patients, with <f>very serious illnesses</f>, when treated in <cc state="other">short-term care facilities</cc> manifest <d certainty="general">physical changes, including muscle tension and epileptic seizures</d>, due to the stress of the hospital environment.
<timex3 type="date">Here</timex3> we report a case involving a young patient who <d certainty="positive">is severely handicapped, both mentally and physically</d>.
An increase in <d certainty="positive">muscle tension</d> triggered a <d certainty="positive">worsening of his respiratory status</d>, which resulted in the patient being put on a <r state="executed">ventilator</r>.
<timex3 type="med">While on the ventilator</timex3>, we were able to <c>relieve</c> the muscle <d certainty="positive">tension</d> and to <r state="executed">assist sputum expectoration</r>, as a result of which the respiratory condition started to show <c>improvement</c>.
Actual Case File Excerpt: Mr. A, male <timex3 type="age">in his 20s;</timex3> name of disease: <d certainty="positive">cerebral palsy and mental disability</d>.
He had been <timex3 type="med">put on</timex3> a <r state="executed">ventilator (Trilogy 100)</r> for <timex3 type="duration">24 hours</timex3>.
After being assured the patient's right to privacy would be protected, the family consented to the presentation of the case.
Practical Nursing Issue: High risk of <d certainty="positive">worsening respiratory status</d> due to <d certainty="positive">increased muscle tension</d>.
Nursing Goal: To <c>reduce</c> the level of <d certainty="positive">muscle tension</d> in order to <f>minimize</f> the risk of a <d certainty="positive">worsening respiratory status</d>.
Patient presented with <a>full body</a> <d certainty="positive">flexion</d>, <d certainty="positive">considerable contortion due to muscle tension</d> of the <a>upper extremities</a>, <c>decreased</c> levels of <t-key>SpO2 and single ventilatory volume</t-key>, <c>increased</c> <t-key>heart and respiratory rate</t-key> and inadequate ventilation.
A towel was placed under the patient and used to support the patient's <a>lower limbs and trunk</a> and expand the plane to help maintain the stability of his <a>limbs</a>.
The nurses also took measures to insure that their <r state="executed">voice and physical touch</r> were comforting, that the patient's favorite music was played and a relaxing, comfortable environment was maintained.
As a result, the <a>full body</a> <d certainty="negative">flexion</d> <c>completely abated</c> and the patient was observed to smile.
The next steps involved performing <r state="executed">postural drainage</r> and deploying <r state="executed">assisted cough physiotherapy to improve sputum expectoration</r>, timed with the patient's inhalations, in addition to performing external rotation of the <a>upper extremities</a>, all of which resulted in an <c>increase</c> in the <t-key>SpO2</t-key> level.
Discussion: When working to reduce <d certainty="general">muscle tension</d>, it is necessary to consider the factors that give rise to the condition, the appropriate psychology to apply during treatment and how to best manage the patient's posture.
For Mr. A, who is himself unable to verbally communicate, but responds when spoken to, emotional support through the use of comforting <r state="executed">voice and physical touch</r> during therapy, made for a relaxing and comfortable environment, which proved effective in <c>reducing</c> the <d certainty="positive">muscle tension</d>.
In addition, it was important to <c>improve</c> the respiratory condition, which was achieved by using individualized <r state="executed">thorax expansion exercises and squeezing physiotherapy</r> to facilitate better <d certainty="positive">sputum</d> expectoration, along with the use of breathing exercises to promote better ventilation.
Conclusion: There is a close relationship between <d certainty="general">abnormal muscle tension</d> and <d certainty="general">deformity, contracture and respiratory disorders</d>.
Efforts to determine and eliminate the causes of <d certainty="general">muscle tension</d> will help prevent <d certainty="general">respiratory complications</d>.

<timex3 type="med">After surgery</timex3>, (procedure: <r state="other">hepatoportoenterostomy</r>), for <d certainty="general">biliary atresia</d>, in many cases it is difficult to control a patient's <d certainty="general">gastrointestinal bleeding, including the rupture of gastroesophageal varices</d>, due to <f>severe</f> <d certainty="general">portal hypertension</d>.
In cases of <d certainty="general">biliary atresia</d>, <f>intractable</f> and <f>massive</f> <d certainty="general">gastrointestinal bleeding</d> is an important indication for <a>liver</a> <r state="other">transplant</r>, even for patients who have yet to present <d certainty="general">liver failure</d>.
For <timex3 type="date">this</timex3> report we investigated several cases involving uncontrolled <d certainty="positive">gastrointestinal bleeding</d> that resulted in a <a>liver</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> being performed <timex3 type="duration">within one month</timex3> of <d certainty="positive">hemorrhage</d>.
Of the 1,411 patients who were given a <a>liver</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> at our hospital, from <timex3 type="date">June 1990</timex3> to the <timex3 type="date">end of August 2010</timex3>, 550 had <d certainty="positive">biliary atresia</d>, of which 136 had <d certainty="positive">gastrointestinal bleeding</d>, an indication that a liver transplant might be necessary.
Of these, the 26 patients who were given a <a>liver</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> <timex3 type="duration">within one month</timex3>, due to uncontrollable <d certainty="positive">bleeding</d>, are the focus of this report.
Patients' ages ranged from <timex3 type="age">8 months</timex3> to <timex3 type="age">14 years, 8 months</timex3> (mean <timex3 type="age">4 years, 2 months</timex3>) with the male to female ratio at 10:16.
<a>Hemorrhagic site</a>-based classification of the cases is as follows: <d certainty="positive">small bowel hemorrhage</d> for 10 of the patients, <d certainty="positive">rupture of gastroesophageal varices</d> for 6 of the patients, <d certainty="positive">hemorrhage</d> from both sides for 6 of the patients, and <f>indeterminate hemorrhagic site</f> for 4 of the patients.
<r state="executed">Endoscopic treatment, e.g. sclerotherapy and ligation</r>, is first performed in an effort to arrest <d certainty="positive">bleeding from esophageal varices</d>.
If this fails, and there are repeat episodes of <d certainty="positive">rebleeding</d>, and even after deploying <r state="executed">S-B tubes</r> the <c>bleeding will not stop</c>, a <a>liver</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> is indicated.
In a <d certainty="positive">small bowel hemorrhage</d>, <d certainty="positive">bleeding</d> from the <a>Roux-en-Y limb including the intestinal fistula</a> is <f>common</f> and difficult to treat even with the use of <t-test state="executed">angiography</t-test>.
A <a>liver</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> is indicated when <c>hemostasis does not occur</c>, even after trying <r state="executed">conservative treatment, e.g. fasting and blood transfusion</r>.
In the case of a <a>liver</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> being undertaken for the treatment of <d certainty="positive">portal hypertension</d>, especially in small children, <p>if the portal vein main blood flow</p> is <f>insufficient</f>, <a>collateral vessels, such as coronary veins or a splenorenal shunt</a>, can be utilized to control blood flow.
Furthermore, the <a>retroperitoneal</a>, <p>blood flow</p> can be <r state="executed">shut off</r>, which results in the <p>blood flow of the portal vein</p> being protected.
If <d certainty="positive">bleeding</d> from the <a>Roux-en Y limb</a> occurs, the <a>collateral blood vessels</a>, which are the source of bleeding, can be treated by <r state="executed">dissecting</r> the <a>intestine</a> and <a>liver</a>.
The <timex3 type="med">postoperative</timex3> course was comparatively good with 21 of the 26 patients (81%) surviving the surgery, including a child who was <d certainty="positive">in pre-shock</d>, prior to the surgery, due to <timex3 type="med">preoperative</timex3> <d certainty="positive">bleeding</d>.

<article id="JP0478-2" title="胆道閉鎖症術後成人女性に対する肝移植の適応について―症例報告">
Introduction: In Japan <r state="other">living donor transplants</r> are generally confined to patients who are post puberty, who have been carrying on <p>with their own liver,</p>and for some patients who have reached adulthood without receiving a transplant, it can be said that although their lives are characterized by a <f>significantly</f> <d certainty="positive">poor QOL</d>, the disease <f>has yet to prove fatal</f>.
It is all of these factors that make it difficult to decide when is best to undergo a <r state="other">liver transplant</r>.
In <timex3 type="date">this study</timex3>, a <r state="executed">living donor liver transplant</r> was undertaken for a <timex3 type="age">33-year-old</timex3> female patient <timex3 type="med">following surgery</timex3> to relieve both <d certainty="positive">biliary atresia</d> and <f>repeated</f> episodes of <d certainty="positive">cholangitis</d>.
Case Study: Patient underwent a <r state="executed">hepatoportoenterostomy</r> at <timex3 type="age">98 days of age</timex3>.
Procedure was performed at another hospital.
The patient had undergone <c>PTC</c> and was enjoying a reasonable QOL, however upon <timex3 type="misc">entering high school</timex3> she was <f>repeatedly</f> <r state="executed">hospitalized</r> due to <d certainty="positive">cholangitis and subileus</d>.
At  <timex3 type="age">29</timex3>, she married, relocated and started to visit our hospital for <cc state="executed">follow-up</cc> treatment.
After turning <timex3 type="age">32</timex3>, she needed to be <cc state="executed">hospitalized</cc> <timex3 type="set">5 times</timex3> <timex3 type="duration">over the course of the year</timex3>.
The <a>left lobe of the liver</a> was <f>remarkably</f> <d certainty="positive">atrophied</d> and revealed a <d certainty="positive">bile lake</d> on <t-test state="executed">echo and CT</t-test>.
It was also determined that <a>B6</a> was <d certainty="positive">extended</d>.
<t-test state="executed">Cholangiography</t-test> from <a>B6</a> showed <f>many</f> <d certainty="positive">intrahepatic stones</d> with <f>withered branching</f> of the <a>intrahepatic bile ducts</a>, however the <t-test state="executed">blood test</t-test> results were: <t-key>TP</t-key> <t-val>7.3 g/dl</t-val>, <t-key>Alb</t-key> <t-val>4.5 g/dl</t-val> and <t-key>chE</t-key> <t-val>301 IU/l</t-val>, with preserved synthetic capacity and no evidence of <d certainty="negative">portal hypertension</d>.
Although for the <timex3 type="date">foreseeable future</timex3> the patient was <f>not felt to be in imminent danger</f>, she was <f>easily</f> <d certainty="positive">fatigued</d> and refrained from leaving the house, to the point that her <d certainty="positive">QOL had been greatly compromised</d>.
Although the patient's mother was a possible donor, she was <timex3 type="age">63 years old</timex3> at the time and an age restriction could make it difficult for her to still be a donor if the decision was put off for any longer.
Furthermore, a <a>liver M</a> <r state="executed">transplant</r> could make it possible for the patient to have children of her own.
With these factors in mind, we presented the option of a <r state="scheduled">living donor liver transplant</r> to the patient and her family.
At the mutual request of the patient and her family, a <r state="executed">living donor liver transplant</r> was performed <timex3 type="date">approximately 6 months later</timex3>.
On the <timex3 type="med">second day after the transplant</timex3> operation the patient required <r state="executed">reanastomosis</r> due to <d certainty="positive">decreased hepatic artery blood flow</d>, but progressed smoothly <timex3 type="date">thereafter</timex3> and is now <timex3 type="duration">7 months</timex3> <timex3 type="med">post-transplant</timex3>.
Conclusion: Although the objective is to improve the QOL for an adult patient, the indications for a <r state="other">living donor liver transplant</r> are complicated, given that the lifestyle and circumstances of each patient are different and must be taken into account.
Hence it is difficult to standardize the decision criteria.
Many patients have adjusted to living with a <f>chronic disease</f>, which makes it difficult for them to reach a decision as to when to undergo a <a>liver</a> <r state="other">transplant</r>; thus it is important for medical professionals, at the earliest opportunity, to provide medical advice vis-a-vis a <a>liver</a> <r state="other">transplant</r>.

Here we report a case of a female patient <timex3 type="age">in her 20s</timex3> suffering from chronic <d certainty="positive">biliary atresia</d>, which she had from childhood, and who became <d certainty="positive">depressed</d> and underwent <r state="executed">psychiatric treatment</r>.
The patient had a history of <d certainty="positive">cutting her wrists</d> along with symptoms of <f>mild to moderate</f> <f>mental</f> <f>instability</f>, although until reaching adulthood her physical condition and treatment progress had both been comparatively good.
After becoming an adult, the patient underwent <f>various</f> <d certainty="positive">stressful situations</d> along with <f>repeated</f> episodes of <d certainty="positive">cholangitis</d>.
A <f>pathological</f> <d certainty="positive">dependency and depression</d> were diagnosed.
This case suggests that the patient's <d certainty="positive">pathological dependency</d> was caused by her difficulty in dealing with the ongoing <d certainty="positive">biliary atresia</d>, exacerbated by a lack of adequate support from her family.
<r state="executed">Psychiatric treatment (pyschopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy)</r> both proved effective for the treatment of the <d certainty="positive">pathological dependency and depression</d>.
This case makes clear the danger of a patient developing a post adolescent <d certainty="general">pathological dependency</d>, when a chronic disease, i.e. <d certainty="general">biliary atresia</d>, has been a part of the patient's life since childhood.
In order to prevent such pathological dependence it is vital there be a support system in which the family fully embraces the patient in all aspects, and thus makes it possible for the patient to both understand and accept their disease while working towards independence, and become an adult.

Introduction: Sorabuchi Kids Camp offers a camping experience not only for <d certainty="general">children fighting cancer</d> but also for <d certainty="general">children with an excretory disorder</d>.
Sharing food, clothing and being under the same roof with other children who require an <r state="executed">ostomy pouch</r> is a great opportunity for them to realize that they are not alone in dealing with this condition.
Case Report: A <timex3 type="age">17-year-old</timex3> juvenile male presenting with <d certainty="positive">cloacal exstropy</d>.
The patient was born with the male <f>sex chromosome XY</f>, but during infancy was considered female because of having a condition of <d certainty="positive">ambiguous external genitalia</d>.
However, when the patient started school, she exhibited <f>remarkable behavior</f>, including <d certainty="positive">acting as if she were a boy, both physically and emotionally</d>, thinking that it would be more appropriate for her sex (F) listed on the family register be changed to (M), so she could start living life as a man.
Around this time the opportunity to go to camp arose.
To make it possible, the patient started to practice using the <r state="executed">ostomy pouch</r> on his own; up until then he had been dependent on this mother.
This case report focuses on how camp life, which was the first opportunity for the patient to socially interact after changing his name to a masculine one, impacted on his emotional state and behaviour.

In this case, <d certainty="positive">epithelioid cell granulomas</d> were found in two organs, the <a>skin</a> and <d certainty="positive">lymph nodes</d>, suggesting <d certainty="suspicious">sarcoidosis</d>.
However, given that <f>extensive</f> <d certainty="positive">necrosis</d> was found in the <d certainty="positive">skin lesions</d>, we found it difficult to distinguish from <d certainty="suspicious">tuberculosis</d>.
<d certainty="general">Necrosis</d> is also observed in <d certainty="general">sarcoidosis</d> in 10-15% of cases, but the <f>necrosis diameter is limited to about 300 μm</f>, whereas in this case, the <d certainty="positive">necrosis</d> was <f>several millimeters</f> in diameter, which made it possible to confirm using the naked eye.

Clinical Progress Following Start of Treatment: The patient had a <c>temporary relapse</c> following a <c>rapid tapering </c> of the <m-key state="executed">PSL</m-key> dose.
<d certainty="positive">Peripheral Airway Obstruction</d>: The <t-key>arterial blood gas</t-key> findings, <t-test state="executed">chest CT scan</t-test> and <t-key>respiratory function</t-key> suggested the presence of a <d certainty="positive">peripheral airway obstruction</d>.

Conclusion: 1) The onset of <d certainty="positive">HS</d> took place <timex3 type="med">during the administration</timex3> of <m-key state="executed">carbamazepine</m-key>.
2) <c>Another relapse</c> occurred <timex3 type="med">during tapering</timex3> of the <m-key state="executed">steroid</m-key> dosage.

Clinical Course: <timex3 type="misc">Since birth</timex3>, the infant had been given milk by injecting it through a <r state="executed">gastric tube</r> due to <d certainty="positive">dysphagia</d>.
<f>Intractable</f> <d certainty="positive">vomiting</d> <c>presenting</c> from around the age of <timex3 type="age">13 months</timex3>.
Given that his <d certainty="positive">GER</d> was <c>getting worse</c>, <m-key state="executed">PPIs</m-key> were tried but did not prove effective.
Because of the <f>high</f> <t-key>eosinophil count</t-key>, and taking his <d certainty="positive">milk allergy</d> into account, the infant was switched to a <m-key state="executed">highly hydrolyzed formula</m-key>, and his symptoms <c>improved</c>.
However, because of persistent <d certainty="positive">nausea</d>, the infant was switched to <m-key state="executed">amino acid non-allergenic milk (Elental®P)</m-key>, but even so the <d certainty="positive">vomiting</d> grew <c>worse again</c>.
For this reason, the infant was changed from <r state="negated">tube feeding</r> to <r state="executed">central venous feeding</r>.
The symptoms, although <c>mild</c>, proved <c>persistent</c>.
A <t-test state="executed">gastric biopsy</t-test> showed <d certainty="positive">eosinophilic infiltration</d>, and <d certainty="positive">eosinophilic gastroenteritis</d> was the diagnosis reached.
Taking into consideration that the contamination of soy protein in <m-key state="negated">fatty preparations</m-key> could be the causative agent, the preparation was <c>discontinued</c> and, as a result, the symptoms <c>disappeared</c>.

There have been few reports of an <d certainty="positive">allergic reaction</d> to soybean protein in <m-key state="executed">fat preparations</m-key>, and to our knowledge, no case of <d certainty="positive">eosinophilic gastroenteritis</d> has been reported to date.

<timex3 type="med">About one year before the initial diagnosis</timex3>, the patient was able to consume ordinary tofu but began to feel <d certainty="positive">throat discomfort</d> only <timex3 type="misc">when consuming</timex3> oboro tofu or yuba.
She <timex3 type="date">used to</timex3> drink soy milk without any abnormality, but has not drunk soy milk <timex3 type="misc">since the onset of symptoms</timex3> caused by oboro tofu and yuba.
<t-key>Specific IgE</t-key> was <t-val>class 5</t-val> positive in birch and alder, <t-val>class 3</t-val> positive in peach and apple, <t-val>class 2</t-val> positive in strawberry, and <t-val>class 1</t-val> positive in soybeans.
The <t-test state="executed">prick test</t-test> was (<t-val>3+</t-val>) positive in soy milk and soybeans, and (<t-val>2+</t-val>) positive in oboro tofu, yuba, and tofu.
Therefore, we diagnosed our patient as <d certainty="positive">allergic to tofu</d> caused by the mechanism of <d certainty="positive">OAS</d>.
In <timex3 type="date">recent years</timex3>, there have been many reports of cases of <d certainty="general">soy milk allergy</d>, but almost all cases are able to consume regular tofu.
The only difference in composition between soy milk and tofu is the bittern content.
However, the difference in antigenicity between the two has been speculated to be due to the fact that soy milk is in a solution state and is more easily absorbed from the oral mucosa than tofu, resulting in <d certainty="general">OAS</d>.
We thought that the results of our own study, in which the symptoms occurred only <timex3 type="misc">when taking</timex3> oboro tofu and yuba, which are more watery than regular tofu, supported such a hypothesis.

<timex3 type="date">We</timex3> report a case of <d certainty="positive">traumatic abdominal wall hernia caused by traffic trauma</d>.
Case Report: The patient is <timex3 type="age">27 years old</timex3>, female.
<timex3 type="misc">While riding her bicycle</timex3> <timex3 type="time">at around 5:00 a.m.</timex3>, she collided with a private car and was <d certainty="positive">injured</d>, striking her <a>lower right abdomen</a>.
The patient was <cc state="executed">transported to another hospital for emergency treatment</cc> and was under <cc state="executed">observation</cc>.
However, the <timex3 type="date">next day</timex3>, the <d certainty="positive">abdominal pain</d> <c>intensified</c>, and the patient was referred <cc state="executed">to</cc> our hospital.
<timex3 type="med">At the time of admission,</timex3> the vital signs were stable, and there was <d certainty="positive">redness due to trauma</d> on the <a>lower right abdomen</a>, but no <d certainty="negative">bulging</d>.

The <a>hepatic arterial</a> <d certainty="general">travel abnormality</d> is thought to occur embryologically when the four <a>basic mesenteric arterial groups (left gastric artery, hepatic artery, splenic artery, and superior mesenteric artery)</a> in the <a>upper abdomen</a> develop and disappear <a>longitudinally and transversely in the interarterial anastomotic branches</a>, causing their diversity.

Although the <d certainty="positive">inflammation</d> was <f>severe</f>, the patient's general condition was stable with <d certainty="positive">localized peritonitis</d>, and we judged that there was a high risk of treating the <a>major blood vessels</a> during <r state="scheduled">surgery</r> and that a cure could not be obtained.
We preceded surgery with <r state="executed">conservative treatment</r> based on fasting and <m-key state="executed">antibiotics</m-key> administration.

Case Report: <timex3 type="age">27-year-old</timex3> female.
No history of disease.
In <timex3 type="date">December 2012</timex3>, the patient was <cc state="executed">brought to our emergency room</cc> with <f>severe</f> <d certainty="positive">abdominal pain</d> and <d certainty="positive">rectal bleeding</d>.
Diagnosis of <d certainty="positive">small bowel hemorrhage</d> by <t-test state="executed">contrast-enhanced CT abdomen</t-test>.
The patient was in <d certainty="positive">hemorrhagic shock</d> <timex3 type="med">at the time of admission</timex3> and was transfused with <m-val>8 units</m-val> of <m-key state="executed">concentrated red blood cells</m-key>.
Urgent <r state="executed">IVR</r> was performed to find the source of bleeding and to control hemostasis.
The <d certainty="positive">ruptured vessel</d> and the <a>surrounding jejunum</a> (<f>approximately 10 cm</f>) were <r state="executed">embolized</r> with <r state="executed">microcoils</r>, <m-key state="executed">cyanoacrylate, and lipiodol</m-key>.
<timex3 type="time">Immediately afterwards</timex3>, an emergency <r state="executed">partial resection</r> of the <a>small bowel</a> was performed.
A small <f>4 cm</f> <r state="executed">laparotomy</r> was performed and the responsible lesion was identified using <timex3 type="med">intraoperative</timex3> fluoroscopy.
The lesion was located <a>150 cm from the Treitz ligament and 440 cm from the terminal ileum</a>, and a <r state="executed">partial</r> <a>jejunal</a> resection of <f>approximately 8 cm</f> was performed.

Since the <d certainty="positive">inflammation</d> was <f>localized</f> and the <a>intestinal</a> blood flow was maintained, <r state="executed">conservative treatment with insertion of an ileus tube</r> was started.
However, the patient <c>did not improve</c> even on the <timex3 type="date">third sick day</timex3>, and <r state="executed">emergency surgery</r> was performed because it was judged that the patient was in a state of <d certainty="positive">complete obstruction</d>.
On <r state="executed">opening the abdomen</r>, the <a>appendix</a> was <f>fibrously</f> <d certainty="positive">adherent</d> to the <a>ileum about 3 cm from the terminal ileum</a>, forming a <d certainty="positive">band</d> and <d certainty="positive">strangulating</d> the <a>ileum</a>.

The <d certainty="positive">mass</d> was also seen on <t-test state="executed">CT scan</t-test> to <d certainty="positive">drain</d> <a>the inferior vena cava ventrally</a> and the <a>right adrenal gland cephalad</a>.
Based on the above, the <timex3 type="med">preoperative</timex3> diagnosis of <d certainty="positive">gallbladder stone disease and retroperitoneal tumor</d> was made.
<timex3 type="date">Initially</timex3>, the patient requested only <r state="other">removal</r> of <a>gallbladder</a>, so a <r state="executed">single-hole</r> <r state="executed">laparoscopic cholecystectomy</r> was performed.

The <d certainty="positive">mass</d> was <f>smooth-surfaced</f> and <f>elastic-hard</f>.
Histologically, it was diagnosed as a <d certainty="positive">hematoma</d> because it was <f>surrounded by a thick fibrous membrane</f> in a <f>circumferential</f> fashion and the <a>interior</a> consisted of <f>blood and unstructured material</f>.
Conclusion: Histologically, various <d certainty="general">tumors</d> rarely <c>occur</c> in the <a>retroperitoneum</a>, and <f>the probability</f> of <f>malignancy</f> is high.
However, there are few <f>specific</f> findings in clinical symptoms and <t-test state="other">imaging studies</t-test>, and histological examination by <t-test state="other">biopsy</t-test> is also difficult.
Histological study by <r state="other">laparoscopic excision</r> is a less invasive and useful examination and treatment method.

<r state="executed">Permanent urethral stent</r>: <timex3 type="age">83 years old</timex3> <timex3 type="med">at the time of re-implantation of the change</timex3> to <r state="executed">Memotherm</r>.
<timex3 type="date">Previous</timex3> <timex3 type="med">catheter life duration</timex3> averaged <timex3 type="duration">7 months</timex3>.
The method was as follows: under <r state="executed">local anesthesia</r>, a <r state="negated">temporary urethral stent</r> was <timex3 type="med">removed</timex3> and a <r state="executed">permanent urethral stent</r> was implanted.
At <a>3 mm distal to the bladder neck</a>, the handle was pulled <timex3 type="set">several times</timex3> to start releasing the <r state="executed">stent</r> and wait <timex3 type="duration">2-3 minutes</timex3> while infusing warm water.
The <r state="executed">stent</r> was <timex3 type="date">then</timex3> slowly opened and implanted 5 mm shorter than the measured value.
<timex3 type="med">After the self-drainage test</timex3>, a 14Fr, <r state="executed">balloon catheter</r> was indwelt <timex3 type="duration">for 3 days</timex3>.
Results: All patients were able to urinate on their own.
<t-key>MFR</t-key> was <t-val>18.9 ml/sec</t-val>, <t-key>IPSS</t-key> was <t-val>6</t-val>, and <c>QOL and ADL were improved</c>.
It is <timex3 type="duration">over 10 years</timex3> old and the permanent mold is still functioning well.
Discussion: <r state="other">Stents</r> in urology started with Fabian's spiral type, but there were many inconveniences such as <d certainty="general">stone adhesion</d>, difficulty in exchange and removal, migration, UTI, and difficulty in <r state="other">catheter reinsertion</r>.
The device was <r state="executed">changed and reimplantation</r> was performed with an improved permanent-type device, which led to an adequate response to treatment using <r state="executed">TUL and cystoscopy</r>.
There has also been experience with a <r state="executed">double stent</r>.
<r state="executed">Permanent urethral stents</r> were also useful in the long term.

<article id="JP1730-4" title="原発性肺癌を合併した膀胱癌症例の検討">
Targets and Methods: Five patients with both <d certainty="positive">bladder cancer and lung cancer</d>, who were histopathologically diagnosed as <d certainty="positive">primary tumors</d> at our hospital were selected.
Their background, diagnostic history, and histology were gathered.
Results 1: Four males and one female.
Four patients <t-val>had</t-val> a <t-key>history of smoking</t-key>.
There were 4 cases of <f>prior</f> <d certainty="positive">bladder cancer</d> and 1 case of <f>prior</f> <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d>.
One patient was diagnosed during the treatment of a <d certainty="positive">previous cancer</d>, one patient was diagnosed during a <t-test state="executed">medical checkup</t-test>, and the other three patients <cc state="executed">visited</cc> the department directly after complaining of symptoms.
All <d certainty="positive">bladder cancers</d> were <d certainty="positive">urothelial carcinoma</d>, with 4 cases of <f>non-muscle layer invasion</f> and 1 case of <f>invasion</f>.
In <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d>, <d certainty="positive">squamous cell carcinoma</d> and <d certainty="positive">adenocarcinoma</d> were detected in 2 cases each.
The remaining case is scheduled for <r state="scheduled">surgery</r>.
<d certainty="positive">Bladder cancer</d> was treated with <r state="executed">TUR-Bt</r> in 4 cases and <a>total</a> <r state="executed">cystectomy</r> in 1 case.
For <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d>, there were 3 cases of <r state="executed">surgery</r> and 2 cases of <r state="negated">inoperability</r>.
Two patients <c>died</c> of <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d>, one patient was <c>cured</c> of both <d certainty="positive">bladder cancer and lung cancer</d>, and one patient had <c>no recurrence</c> of <d certainty="positive">bladder cancer</d>, and <d certainty="positive">lung cancer</d> <f>was in progress</f>.
Discussion: In <d certainty="general">cancer</d> patients, various examinations are performed, and it is not uncommon for other diseases to be detected incidentally during these examinations.
However, in the <timex3 type="date">present study</timex3>, there were three cases out of five in which the <d certainty="positive">late-stage cancer</d> had already become an <d certainty="positive">advanced cancer</d> despite regular visits to <cc state="executed">the hospital</cc>.
Because all <f>prior</f> cases of <d certainty="positive">bladder cancer</d> were <d certainty="positive">non-muscle invasive cancer</d>, <t-test state="negated">chest CT scan</t-test> was not performed.
Considering that the prognosis of <d certainty="general">lung cancer</d> is generally severe, a <t-test state="other">chest CT scan</t-test> should be performed in the <cc state="other">follow-up</cc> of <d certainty="general">bladder cancer</d>, especially in smokers and those with a history of other <d certainty="general">malignant tumors</d>, even if <c>complete cure</c> is achieved.
